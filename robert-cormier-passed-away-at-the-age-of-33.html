He was only 33 years old. His obituary listed the day he died, and although the cause of death was not specified, Cormier’s sister reported that he died in a hospital in Etobicoke, Ontario, after suffering from injuries sustained in an unlucky fall.</p><h2>More about the character of Robert Cormier in Heartland</h2><p>Cormier rose to prominence as Al Cotter’s grandson, Finn Cotter, in Heartland. The character was a possible love interest for Amy Fleming. Following his death, Up TV, which broadcasts Heartland, paid homage on social media by publishing a photo of him with Amber Mitchell with the caption:</p><p>“Robert Cormier, called Heartland’s Finn, was a phenomenal performer who left us much too soon.” We are heartbroken to learn of his death. Our hearts go out to his friends, family, and coworkers.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Robert-Cormier-1.jpg alt="Robert Cormier" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Heartland’s official Instagram page also paid respect, noting that Robert Cormier has been a part of the program for the previous two seasons. The character is slated to feature in the next 16th season, which is planned to launch on October 2, 2022, and is now accessible to watch on platforms like as Netflix, Hulu, BYUtv, COZI TV, and others.</p><h2>Everything there is to know about Robert Cormier</h2><p>Cormier was noted in his obituary as an athlete, actor, and kind brother. It further said that he was “passionate about helping people” and wished to do more, adding:</p><p>“He loved going to the movies with his family and looked up to his father.” Throughout his life, he had an effect on many individuals, including family, teammates, and friends. Rob’s legacy will live on via his love of art and movies, as well as his three sisters who meant everything to him.”</p><p>Heartland is based on author Lauren Brooke’s novel series about Amy Fleming and her sister Louise “Lou” Fleming, who live on their family ranch with their grandpa Jack Bartlett, father Tim Fleming, and farmhand Ty Borden. The book follows the family’s ups and downs on the ranch as their family relationships strengthen day by day. Cormier first appeared as Kit Jenning in the Netflix series Slasher. According to IMDb, he has also appeared as a guest on episodes such as Designated Survivor, Ransom, American Gods, and others. He has also starred in movies such as Firecrackers, Pyrenees, The Intersection, and Transmission: Vol. 1.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Robert-Cormier.jpeg alt="Robert Cormier" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Twitter users pay tribute</h2><p>Cormier became renowned for his roles in cinema and television throughout the years, so when fans learned of his death, Twitter was swamped with passionate condolences.
