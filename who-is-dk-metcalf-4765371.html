Normani, 26, wore a little black dress for the evening, accented with a bit of sparkle around her neck and ankles.

It’s unclear the status of their relationship. <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>has reached out to Normani’s camp for information and will update this post with additional news. In the meantime, here’s what you need to know about DK Metcalf.</p><h2>DK Metcalf Is An American Football Wide Receiver</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/normani-with-dk-metcalfe-ss-embed.jpg alt width=620 height=413 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>DeKaylin Zecharius “DK” Metcalf was born December 14, 1997, in Oxford, Mississippi. He attended Oxford High School but started playing football when he was a sixth-grader, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Clarion Ledger</a>. He attended the University of University and played in the first two games of his freshman year before suffering a season-ending foot injury. After that setback, he was granted a redshirt status and played two more seasons for Ole Miss. During his college career, he played in 21 games, where he scored 67 receptions for 1,228 yards and 14 touchdowns. Following the 2018 season, DK declared himself eligible for the 2019 NFL Draft.</p><h2>The Seattle Seahawks Drafted Him in 2019</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>The Seattle Seahawks selected DK in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft. He was the 64th overall pick, and the ninth of 28 wide receivers drafted that year. “When the Seahawks took him in the second round, a slip that surprised many, the thought was he could be a spectacular matchup nightmare… or a bust,” writes <strong>Stacy Rost</strong> for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Seattle Sports</a>. “Turns out the gamble was worth it, and as is rarely the case, a player whose measurables seemed too good to be true, in fact, were not.”</p><h2>He’s A Rising Talent</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>DK Metcalf quickly made a name for himself. In his first three seasons in the NFL, he racked up 216 receptions for 3,170 yards and 29 touchdowns in regular-season play. DK set an NFL record for most receiving yards by a rookie in a playoff game in 2020, picking up seven receptions for 160 yards and a touchdown. “He just had a phenomenal night,” coach Pete Carroll said after the victory over the Philadelphia Eagles, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sports Illustrated</a>. “Showed you what he’s capable of looking like. He’s had a great season in his rookie year, but to have a night like that first chance ever in the playoffs, that was spectacular.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Heading into the final year of his rookie contract, DK could follow <b>Ciara’s</b>&nbsp;husband<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Russell Wilson </strong></a>and get traded to a team (like how the Seahawks sent Wilson to the <strong>Denver Broncos </strong>as part of a massive deal.)</p><h2>He’s A Second-Generation NFL Star</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>DK’s father is <strong>Terrence Metcalf</strong>, who played as an offensive lineman for the Chicago Bears from 2002 to 2008. When the Bears secured a spot in the 2006 Super Bowl, DK – who was eight years old – was there by his father’s side. “I got invited into the locker room, and I got to hold the trophy and celebrate with the players,” DK said, per the Clarion Ledger. “It was really fun to be around.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>DK was born during Terrence’s freshman year at Ole Miss, giving him a unique perspective while growing up. “(DK) got to be around a lot of guys who were really good at the game,” Terrence said. “When he was in about the second or third grade, (former Bears safety) <strong>Bobby Gray</strong> started working with him. At that age when you’re a parent trying to train your child, they don’t want to listen to you, so you get them with someone else. … The things he remembers helped him become a better receiver. He remembers all of the passing routes he was taught by the guys in the NFL.”</p><h2>You Can Start Your Day With DK</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>During a 2019 NFL game, ESPN announcer <strong>Joe Tessitore </strong>mistakenly called him “Decaf Metcalf.” Not wanting to waste an opportunity, DK teamed with <strong>Volcania Coffee </strong>to sell “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Decalf Metcalf</a>” coffee. “This is an exquisite blend of decaffeinated beans from Guatemala and Papua New Guinea distinguishable by its sweet yet bold flavor and rich, full body,” reads Volcania’s site.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>This brand of coffee also does some good in the world. Donations from coffee sales will be made to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and Prison Fellowship. It’s Kosher Certified and a medium roast.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KxrHnMnqucmZybenWDlW5qcGlf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-dk-metcalf-4765371.html&text=Who%20Is%20DK%20Metcalf%3f%20NFL%20Star%20Joins%20Normani%20For%20Dinner%20Date%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-dk-metcalf-4765371.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-dk-metcalf-4765371.html&title=Who%20Is%20DK%20Metcalf%3f%20NFL%20Star%20Joins%20Normani%20For%20Dinner%20Date%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-dk-metcalf-4765371.html&title=Who%20Is%20DK%20Metcalf%3f%20NFL%20Star%20Joins%20Normani%20For%20Dinner%20Date%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-dk-metcalf-4765371.html&title=Who%20Is%20DK%20Metcalf%3f%20NFL%20Star%20Joins%20Normani%20For%20Dinner%20Date%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-dk-metcalf-4765371.html&description=Who%20Is%20DK%20Metcalf%3f%20NFL%20Star%20Joins%20Normani%20For%20Dinner%20Date%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jason-blake-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jason Blake Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tony-sunshine.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tony Sunshine">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
