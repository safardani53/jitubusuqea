Gliders need plenty of space to jump and climb."</p><h2>Capybara</h2><p>On first glance, they might look like giant guinea pigs - and you'd be somewhat correct.</p><p>Capybaras, which are native to South Africa, weigh up to 65kg - but they're actually semi-aquatic too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000702489247.jpg><p>So if you fancy having one of your own, you'll need to have a swimming pool that's at least 4ft deep before the council will give you the license you need to adopt a capybara.</p><p>Once you've proven you're capable of owning one of these exotic animals, you need to feed your capybara a diet of grass, vegetables and fruit.</p><p>What's more, their teeth are always growing which means you'll also need to have some chewing sticks on standby so they don't get out of hand.</p><h2>Marmoset Monkey</h2><p>Marmoset monkeys are incredibly intelligent animals that you can currently have as a pet in the UK - but the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RSPCA is campaigning to change this</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000702489295.jpg><p>Why? Not only do they have very specific dietary requirements but they're also very intelligent animals that thrive in rich and complex environment - which you just can't provide at home.</p><p>The monkeys mostly eat tree gum and sap as well as lizards and frogs which can be hard to find in the UK.</p><h2>Octopus</h2><p>Now this one is a bit of a legal grey area - yes you can technically own an octopus but like capybaras, you're going to need a LOT of space.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000702489307-1.jpg><p>What's more, they're super sensitive to pH so you'd need to stay on top of your water quality.</p><p>Earlier this year, octopuses were officially classified as sentient beings - i.e. they're able to perceive and feel things.</p><p>You can currently only buy them from specialist pet shops and they need to be fed frozen krill three times a day.</p><h2>African Pygamy Hedgehog</h2><p>There's no denying that hedgehogs are absolutely adorable - but they're high maintenance pets that you shouldn't just buy on a whim.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000702489370.jpg><p>It's currently legal to own an African pygamy hedgehog in the UK but their natural habitats are savannas in West, East and Central Africa, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RSPCA</a>.</p><p>The Animal Welfare Act means that owners must be able to meet the hedgehog's full welfare needs.</p><p>The RSPCA does not recommend them as pets as they're nocturnal and solitary creatures.</p><p>So despite their adorable appearance, they are still wild animals that won't just slot perfectly into any household.</p><p>If you do go ahead and adopt one, the hedgehogs can live in a rabbit hut - but it must be kept at a constant temperature of around 23 degrees Celsius as they're very sensitive to cold air.</p><h2>Fennecc Fox</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000702489491.jpg><p>On our street, you can find foxes rifling through our bins almost every night - but Fennecc foxes are all together much cuter.</p><p>AND you can currently legally keep them as pets in the UK.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British Pet Insurance</a>, the small desert fox have the "personalities and movements" of a cat with "all of the energy and enthusiasm of a dog".</p><p>The adorable foxes can live up to 14 years and spend roughly 40 per cent of their time sleeping.</p><p>Fancy having one of your own? Then you'll need to feed them a mix of dog and cat food along with vegetables and fruit.</p><h2>Mexican Walking Fish</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000702489441.jpg><p>Can't decide between a fish or a lizard? Then an axolotl might just be the way to go.</p><p>That said, they have to be kept separately to all other fish in case they eat them.</p><p>As the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British Pet Insurance </a>reports, they have "superior regenerative qualities" - meaning they can regrow limbs if they get injured.</p><p>And if you look after them well enough, an axolotl can live for up to 10 years too.</p><h2>Giant African Land Snail</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NINTCHDBPICT000702489344.jpg><p>Whenever it rains, we can easily find about 30 snails lingering around our gardens.</p><p>But if you're mad keen on them, the giant African land snail blows all the other kinds out of the water.</p><p>When they reach full adult size, they weigh roughly the same as a tennis ball and are 7.8 inches in length.</p><p>Although they're legal to own in the UK, it's important that they're kept in a heated cage to avoid disrupting the ecosystem of your local area - i.e. wiping out all other snails.</p><p>For more pet stories, here are the <a href=#>top ten tips to keep your dog safe during New Year’s Eve firework</a> displays.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>And this <a href=#>professional cat behaviourist revealed five top tips for training</a> your feline.</p><p>Plus <a href=#>you’ve been walking your dog all wrong</a> – here are SEVEN top tips for the best behaved dog in the park.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Woman disguises her cat so her landlord won't realise she has a pet... and it's taking people ages to spot the moggy</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BwaG9vYWmDcL%2FUq6eroaOeu6h5wKegppmcqHqxsdOsZKWdl5a5bsHKaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsurprising-animals-pets-legal-uk.html&text=These%20surprising%20animals%20can%20legally%20be%20kept%20as%20pets%20in%20the%20UK%20but%20how%20many%20would%20you%20dare%20to%20have%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsurprising-animals-pets-legal-uk.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsurprising-animals-pets-legal-uk.html&title=These%20surprising%20animals%20can%20legally%20be%20kept%20as%20pets%20in%20the%20UK%20but%20how%20many%20would%20you%20dare%20to%20have%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsurprising-animals-pets-legal-uk.html&title=These%20surprising%20animals%20can%20legally%20be%20kept%20as%20pets%20in%20the%20UK%20but%20how%20many%20would%20you%20dare%20to%20have%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsurprising-animals-pets-legal-uk.html&title=These%20surprising%20animals%20can%20legally%20be%20kept%20as%20pets%20in%20the%20UK%20but%20how%20many%20would%20you%20dare%20to%20have%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsurprising-animals-pets-legal-uk.html&description=These%20surprising%20animals%20can%20legally%20be%20kept%20as%20pets%20in%20the%20UK%20but%20how%20many%20would%20you%20dare%20to%20have%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./f3ygkdpmn0y2ft1b01f1ewzm9rasre9z.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch PAW Patrol Season 6 Episode 17: Pups Save the Bears/Pups Save a Farmerless Farm">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ismael-miranda.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ismael Miranda">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
