Sheri then joined Rob whenever he hit the road with his band, White Zombie, later becoming a dancer, choreographer and costume designer for his solo tours. After nine years of dating, the couple tied the knot on Halloween, fittingly, in 2002.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sherri and Rob have collaborated on many projects, including the White Zombie music video "Living Dead Girl," Rob's first feature film House of 1000 Corpses and his Netflix movie remake of the '60s TV hit, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The Munsters</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite their love for all things spooky, home for the couple doesn't look like a horror set, and is instead filled with laughter and rescue animals. "He's very creative," Sheri said of Rob during a 2007 interview with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Los Angeles Times</a>. "At home, that's all he's ever doing, whether it's painting or writing or whatever. And he's very funny; he makes me laugh all the time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February 2023, the couple <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrated 30 years together</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"From where it all began to where we're at now. Polaroid to digital. Phone booths to cell phones. A lot has changed in 30 years and I'm so freakin' happy I'm going through it all with my soul mate," Sherri captioned a throwback photo on Instagram from when she first met Rob. "You have all my love Rob.

She moved home a couple of times — even attending broadcasting school back east with a dream of doing voiceovers and animation — but now considers herself a California girl.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Seventeen is really young to move out of state and be on your own," Sheri told the blog <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Girls and Corpses</a>. "I mean, I wanted to play and have fun and be responsibility-free but eventually you have to buckle down and get a job. So I was a little wild child when I was younger."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">New England blood runs through the Zombies, as Rob was born one state north in Haverhill, Massachusetts. The singer met Sheri in Connecticut when he performed with White Zombie at Toad's Place in New Haven.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I was kinda mean to you the first night we met, right?" she asked her husband during an interview with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Post</a> in 2013, to which Rob whispered, "Yes."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-rob-got-married-on-halloween></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Rob got married on Halloween</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rob and Sheri were together for nine years before eloping on Halloween in 2002.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It sounds like we're trying to be all spooky and weird, but that really wasn't the plan," Rob told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Post</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sheri added that tying the knot on October 31 was "kinda by accident."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We'd been together for nine years already, and we had the wedding planner and all that stupid stuff, and we were taking a walk in the neighborhood and were like, 'Let's just elope,' " she said. "It was the best thing we did. I was so happy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And, yes, their legal surname is Zombie. Rob had his last name legally changed from Cummings to Zombie in 1996, and when the pair wed, Sheri took the name as well.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-regularly-works-with-rob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She regularly works with </strong>Rob</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Robert Marquardt/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sheri started going on tour with Rob when he was part of White Zombie, and became an even bigger part of his touring life when he went solo, working as a dancer, choreographer and costume designer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What Sheri is best known for, however, is working with her husband as an actress. She got her small screen start in the music video for White Zombie's "Feed the Gods" and was later featured in three other White Zombie videos and 11 Rob Zombie videos. Her most famous music video appearance came in "Living Dead Girl," a sendup to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sheri then shifted her on-camera experience to the big screen, starring in several of Rob's horror films, including 1000 Corpses, The Devil's Rejects and The Lords of Salem.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Both of our first movies were together," Rob told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>New York Post</a>. "So it was like, 'Do you know what you're doing?' 'No.' "Do you know what you're doing?' 'No.' 'Let's do it anyway!' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Sheri has tried her hand at acting gigs outside of the horror genre, including guest starring on episodes of Californication and CSI: Miami, she has previously said she's content making projects with her husband.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Honestly, in the beginning I did feel a lot of pressure to live up to a certain expectation, but now I don't care. I don't read reviews. I know I'm doing the best job I can and Rob's happy with it, and that's all that matters," she said during an interview with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Daily Dead</a>. "We're making what we want to make and what we think the fans will enjoy. That's what is important to me."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Most recently, the couple teamed up on a revival of The Munsters for Netflix, which premiered on Sept. 27, 2022. Rob served as director for the movie remake of the beloved '60s sitcom, and cast Sheri as matriarch Lily Munster.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I wanted to cast people that had worked together a lot," Rob <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told Entertainment Weekly</a> of the project's cast, which also includes the couple's friend Cassandra Peterson, aka Elvira.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We've been friends with Cassandra for I don't even know how long," the director explained. "She was at our wedding, she was at Sheri's shower. We've been friends with her for at least 25 years. So that was another good person that could come in and fit right in, totally familiar."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-her-husband-had-a-typical-courtship></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and her husband had a "typical" courtship</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite the many years they've put into the horror realm, the early days of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Zombies</a>' relationship were anything but scary. When the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>New York Post</a> asked if their dates were to horror films and events, she responded that "he's not that much of a nerd."

At the Woodstock Sanctuary's 14th Annual ThanksLiving Gala in 2019, the couple were given the Woodstock Warrior Award to honor their work against animal abuse. Rob dedicated their award to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Rob Zombie</a>, a duck who bears his name.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"As everyone in this room knows, fighting for animals and being vegan, you're going to take s— from everybody because they think it's not cool. Actually it is cool — they're not cool," Rob said at the time, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Revolver</a>. "But that's just the way it goes. Everybody's coming around. You know, we turn on the TV and see all these horrible, multi-death corporations like Burger King selling their plant-based burgers and last night I saw Dunkin' Donuts had one, so you know, change is happening. Fight the power."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Zombies have also worked with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>PETA</a>, rescuing two goats, Ginger and Claire, through the organization.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-rob-live-on-a-farm></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>She and Rob live on a farm</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Todd Williamson/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While their home base is Los Angeles, the Zombies also live on a farm in Connecticut.
