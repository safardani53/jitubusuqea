They aren't very romantic, but they are patient and would never impose themselves on someone they didn't like. They are normally silent and keep their emotions hidden. Others find it difficult to understand them. When they lose their cool, it's like an explosion that scares people away.</p><p>People born on January 26 have a zodiac sign of <strong>Aquarius</strong>. Despite the "aqua" in its name, Aquarius is the zodiac's final air sign. Aquarius is represented by the water carrier, the mystical healer who bestows water, or life, onto the earth.
