He continued playing football at East Mississippi Community College after matriculating, and while he was very good at that sport, he wasn’t very good at other things, and his grades weren’t satisfactory. He was supposed to begin playing officially, but he suffered a knee dislocation, so instead of playing football, he decided to try to improve his grades.</p><h2>How Tall Is Dacorius Law? Height, Weight & Body Measurement</h2><p>Law is 24 years old, with short black hair and black eyes. <strong>He stands about 5ft 11ins (1.8m) tall and weighs 192lbs because he is an athlete (87kg).</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dac1.jpg><h2>How Did Dacorius Law Pursue His Career? Professional Life</h2><p>There isn’t much to say about Law’s career, but he was a key figure in the Netflix documentary series “Last Chance U,” which was released in 2016. The series is about football players from his college and the difficulties they faced, depicting their daily lives and backstories. It was more than just a show; they had an academic advisor on hand to assist the players with their grades and to ensure that they passed their exams. When the football team was disqualified, they had to stop filming, but they resumed the following year, calling it season two. So far, the show has three seasons and 23 episodes, with an IMDb rating of 8.5/10.</p><p>Because of this film, Law gained some notoriety, and he was invited to play for the University of Alabama, Birmingham football team known as the “Blazers,” which he accepted, but he was injured and missed the entire season. He left the Blazers and was contemplating his next step in football, deciding between NAIA and Canada. Law continued to play football but is no longer in the public eye. On his Instagram account, you can see photos of him during football games. “Last Chance U” has been renewed for a fourth season, which will be shot with the team from Independence Community College.</p><h2>More On Career</h2><p>Law was a guest of honor at Parker High School on October 12, 2017, and delivered a speech in which he stated that he was “trying to motivate the kids” in order to help them make the right decisions. He explained to them that every action they take has a cause and an effect. He stated that he never imagined himself giving motivational speeches, but he felt good about it because he was giving something back to the community.</p><p>Let’s take a look at some of his football stats from the second half of 2018: he had 64 rushes and ran 597 yards (about 85 yards per game). He had three touchdowns, two fumble recoveries, and two fumble losses. He and his team won 6 out of 7 games.</p><h2>Who Is Dacorius Law Dating? Relationship And Affairs</h2><p>Law is not one of those people who enjoy discussing their personal lives. We know his mother’s name is Veronica Purnell, but we don’t know anything about his father. Law’s parents appear to have disagreed because his mother wanted him to attend the University of Mississippi while his father wanted him to attend Utah University. His parents are not living together, but it is unknown whether they are divorced.</p><p>There are no rumors about this football star’s ex-girlfriend, and he appears to be single. However, pictures of him and a small boy, whom he refers to as “his little boy” and “his son,” can be found on his Instagram account. Apparently, Law has a son who lives in Florida with his mother. He is six years old and was born on November 22, 2012 – no information about his mother has been made public.</p><p>Dori Montana is one of his closest friends, whom he refers to as his “bro.” Dori’s songs can be found on YouTube, where he is attempting to establish himself as a rapper.</p><h2>Dacorius Law Net Worth 2023</h2><p>Due to his career is still in its early stages, authoritative sources estimate that<strong> Law’s net worth is still less than $100,000 as of November 2023.</strong></p><h2>Social Media</h2><p>He isn’t particularly active on social media, and he doesn’t care much about them, but his Instagram account “mr.showtimelaw” has nearly 20,000 followers. He joined Twitter in January 2016 and now has nearly 12,000 followers. His Facebook page has approximately 4,500 fans.</p><h2>Facts</h2><li>He is active on social media.</li><li>He is currently single.</li><li>Dacorius likes to fish.</li><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Footballer</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGibmpufp7a2v4ylmLBn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdacorius-law.html&text=Dacorius%20Law-%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Nationality&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdacorius-law.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdacorius-law.html&title=Dacorius%20Law-%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Nationality" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdacorius-law.html&title=Dacorius%20Law-%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Nationality" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdacorius-law.html&title=Dacorius%20Law-%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Nationality" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdacorius-law.html&description=Dacorius%20Law-%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Girlfriend%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career%2c%20Nationality" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./joanna-werner.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Joanna Werner net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./stephanie-harlowe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stephanie Harlowe">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
