More often than not, quarterbacks and wide receivers sport the bag-like pouch, especially during more frigid temperatures. Is there a reason for that? Why do football players wear fanny packs? Wait, is it even really a fanny pack? Let's find out!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why do football players wear fanny packs?</h2><p>Though it mirrors the physical appearance of a fanny pack, the gear around the football player's waist is far from it. If you're unaware, the so-called fanny pack is actually a hand warmer; they play a vital role in football, especially in colder conditions.</p><p>Whether you're watching a Pop Warner level game or a high-stakes professional matchup, plenty of football players don a hand warmer because obviously, you want to keep your hands from freezing off mid-game.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>For a quarterback like <a href=#>Joe Burrow</a>, a hand warmer is incredibly beneficial. Not only will it keep his hands from freezing in between plays, but it will allow him to keep throwing effectively to his teammates.</p><p>When it comes to wide receivers, having a hand warmer is just as important; their hands must be as warm as possible if they want to catch the football and zone in for more yards or, possibly, a touchdown.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Are there different types of hand warmers for football players to use?</h2><p>The last thing anyone wants is a turnover, so if wearing a hand warmer will prevent that and elevate a player's performance level, then, by all means, we feel all players handling the football should consider wearing one. Of course, there are different types of hand warmers, so players want to make sure that the one they use will enhance their gameplay.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Viqtory Sports</a>, there are two types of hand warmers — the traditional one, which wraps around a player's waist, and the one attached to their jersey. The standard hand warmer can be as tight as the player wants, but there is some concern that a defender may completely rip it off. So, that's where the new style of hand warmers comes into play.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The hand warmers directly bound to a player's jersey are prevalent in the NFL, and they "help players from losing them or getting them completely ripped off," the outlet noted. They added that <a href=#>Baltimore Ravens</a> quarterback Lamar Jackson frequently dons this style of hand warmer, which looks like a thick pocket at the front of his uniform.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What do football players put in their hand warmers?</h2><p>If football players want to warm their hands in between plays or before heading onto the field, they need to keep air-activated warmers in the pouch. When the time comes to warm their hands, players will squeeze (or hold) the warmers for approximately 10-20 seconds to gain warmth.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My mom just asked “what do football players put in their fanny packs?” She’s talking about the hand warmers. 🤦‍♂️</p>— Saumdog Millionaire (@therealsaumier) <a href=#>October 14, 2018</a></figure><p>Plus, by keeping the air-activated warmers in there, the pocket will remain warm the entire time — now that's what we call an innovative invention. So, the next time you play a game of football in cold or rainy conditions, consider picking up a hand warmer and saving your hands from harm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOoZJ%2Bnn6mvorjLZqelmamav7R51p6Yq2WWlruvxYypmJyjow%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-do-football-players-wear-fanny-packs.html&text=Why%20Do%20Football%20Players%20Wear%20Fanny%20Packs%3f%20Details&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-do-football-players-wear-fanny-packs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-do-football-players-wear-fanny-packs.html&title=Why%20Do%20Football%20Players%20Wear%20Fanny%20Packs%3f%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-do-football-players-wear-fanny-packs.html&title=Why%20Do%20Football%20Players%20Wear%20Fanny%20Packs%3f%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-do-football-players-wear-fanny-packs.html&title=Why%20Do%20Football%20Players%20Wear%20Fanny%20Packs%3f%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-do-football-players-wear-fanny-packs.html&description=Why%20Do%20Football%20Players%20Wear%20Fanny%20Packs%3f%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brittany-banks-and-yazan-abo-horira-by-the-dead-sea.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brittany Banks and Yazan Abo Horira By the Dead Sea">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-gavin-kaysen-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Gavin Kaysen Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
