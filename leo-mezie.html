But we’re here to give you a synopsis of his life. During our research, we discovered that actor Leo was born in Abia State. He completed his secondary and postsecondary education here.</p><p>He was born on January 25, 1976, and died at the age of 46. Leo was only 20 years old when he began having difficulty finding work as an actor. Leo’s struggle came to an end in 1996, when he was offered a small part in a short film. He had previously performed on school and college stages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Leo-Mezi-1.jpg><h2>Leo Mezie Family</h2><p>His family details, like Leo’s childhood details, are also available in less. The only thing he mentions on Instagram is that he has one older brother. He never mentioned his brother, but he did express his love for his niece. He has shared numerous photos of his niece and captioned some with heartfelt messages for her.</p><p>In one photo of his niece, Leo Mezie wrote, “Uncle Loves You a Lot.” This message confirmed that Leo was not the only child of his African parents; he had one brother. Aside from that, Leo spent his entire life in Nigeria, specifically in Abia State. He was of Nigerian descent.</p><h2>Leo Mezie Death</h2><p>The death of popular Nollywood actor Leo Mezie has sparked widespread grief. Leo died on May 14, 2022. Chioma Toplis, one of his known friends, informed him of his death. Chioma shared a photo of Leo on Instagram with the caption “Leo’s death news with the Nigerian people.” She had the same cause of death as Leo. Chioma revealed that Leo died as a result of post-kidney transplant complications.</p><p>He had a kidney transplant last week, but after a week, he developed severe health complications and died in the hospital. Leo had his first kidney transplant four years ago, and this was his second. He had been suffering from malaria, typhoid, and pneumonia since last year. A high dose of medication used to treat diseases such as malaria damaged his kidney, prompting him to seek a second kidney transplant.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Leo’s success journey began in 1996 when he landed his first short role as an actor, and he worked hard to get more work. He gained popularity in 2003 when he appeared in the film Labists alongside actors Emma Ehummadu, Ernest Asuzu, and Jerry Amilo.</p><p>Throughout his successful career, he has appeared alongside popular actors such as Gentle Jack, Chidi Mokeme, Jerry Williams, Zack Orji, and others. Heart of a Slave, Total War, No Man’s Land, Feel My Pain, and many more are among the famous films that helped Leo Mezie gain a larger fan base in his life.</p><h2>Leo Mezie Wife, Marriage</h2><p>Looking at Leo’s Instagram profile, we discovered that he had never posted a picture of his wife or girlfriend on the platform. However, he married his wife, Maureen Chimezie Onyemachi, in 2010. On October 9, 2018, Leo Mezie posted a photo of himself with actress Mary Uche. He has worked with many other beautiful actresses, including Mary. He has always admired actress Monica Friday’s work. Maureen Chimezie Onyemachi, his wife, worked as a banker in Alba State.</p><h2>Leo Mezie Net Worth</h2><p>Leo has performed admirably in every film, earning a good living. He was estimated to have a net worth of $200000 USD prior to his death. Despite having a large net worth, he raised funds for his second kidney transplant, as did actors such as Apostle Johnson Suleman.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>On November 20, 2018, Leo made his Instagram debut.</li><li>His Instagram account had 6277 followers.</li><li>On Facebook, he has 3.5k followers who admire him.</li><li>He enjoys watching football matches in his spare time.</li><li>Leo had a nice collection of luxury watches.</li><li>Leo usually wore an English suit in his photos.</li></ul><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGijnqddorK7tcRo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fleo-mezie.html&text=Leo%20Mezie-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fleo-mezie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fleo-mezie.html&title=Leo%20Mezie-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fleo-mezie.html&title=Leo%20Mezie-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fleo-mezie.html&title=Leo%20Mezie-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fleo-mezie.html&description=Leo%20Mezie-%20Wiki%2c%20Age%2c%20Height%2c%20Ethnicity%2c%20Wife%2c%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Career" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-is-casey-anthony-now.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where Is Casey Anthony Now?
