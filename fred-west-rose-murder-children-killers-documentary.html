Her body was found in June 1994 in a shallow grave.</p><p>Fred West denied murdering McFall but he is said to have confided to a visitor after his arrest that he stabbed her following an argument.</p><p>This happened before Rosemary West met him.</p><p><strong>Charmaine West</strong></p><p>With Fred in prison for the theft of car tyres and a vehicle tax disc, Rosemary was left to look after Charmaine and Anne Marie.</p><p>The former just eight-years-old, was Fred West’s stepdaughter from his previous marriage.</p><p>A neighbour Tracey is said to have found Charmaine tied to a wooden chair with her hands behind her back with Rosemary standing with a large wooden spoon.</p><p>Rosemary claimed she’d been taken by her mother, but her skeleton was found at the Midland Road property, hidden and missing bones.</p><p><strong>Rena West</strong></p><p>Rena is believed to have been murdered by strangulation.</p><p>Rosemary was not charged for this murder.</p><p><strong>Lynda Gough</strong></p><p>Lynda Gough was the first sexually motivated killing conducted by the Wests.</p><p>She moved into Cromwell Street in April 1973, having had affairs with several lodgers. The Wests later claimed she’d been asked to leave after hitting one of their children.</p><p>Strangulation and suffocation were the likely causes of death.</p><p><strong>Carol Ann Cooper</strong></p><p>Cooper was murdered in November 1973, aged just 15.</p><p>On the night of&nbsp;November 9, she was allowed to spend the night at her grandmother’s house before a doctor’s appointment the next morning.</p><p>She attended the appointment and then met her boyfriend, before somehow ending up on Cromwell Street.</p><p>Her body was found more than twenty years later.</p><p><strong>Lucy Partington</strong></p><p>A 21-year-old medieval English student at Exeter University, she returned home for Christmas in December 1973.</p><p>She left a friend’s house in a rush to get the last bus from Cheltenham to Gretton on 27&nbsp;December, with it believed she was abducted from this bus stop.</p><p>She was found more twenty years later, her dismembered body in the cellar of Cromwell Street.</p><p><strong>Therese Siegenthaler</strong></p><p>A 21-year-old Swiss sociology student at Woolwich Polytechnic.</p><p>She had planned to hitch-hike to Ireland in Easter 1974. Her family reported her missing having not heard from her for some time.</p><p>Prosecution believe she was abducted before being killed, with&nbsp;Fred West later building a fake chimney over her grave.</p><p><strong>Shirley Hubbard</strong></p><p>Just 15 at the time of her death, Hubbard is believed to have been abducted by the Wests.</p><p>Her body was found following an excavation in the concrete and plastic membrane of the cellar floor.</p><p><strong>Juanita Mott</strong></p><p>In the summer of 1974, Mott moved into 25 Cromwell Street but later went missing when she was living in Newent.</p><p>Her body was found in March 1994, 19 years later, with West having concreted over the floor of the cellar.</p><p><strong>Shirley Robinson</strong></p><p>The first victim buried outside the house, Robinson had an affair with Fred West, and by autumn 1977, she was pregnant with West’s child.</p><p>It was initially claimed she had moved to Scotland but her body was later found.</p><p>When questioned, Rosemary West, herself pregnant with her daughter Tara at the time of the murder, claimed she did not remember her, which was described as “ludicrous” by the prosecution.</p><p><strong>Alison Chambers</strong></p><p>The last murder with a sexual motive established. She disappeared just before her 17th&nbsp;birthday, having been seen at 25 Cromwell Street throughout the summer.</p><p>Her body was buried underneath the patio.</p><p><strong>Heather West</strong></p><p>The first child born to Fred and Rosemary West, there is no evidence she was aware of the killings.</p><p>Sexually abused by her parents and having told friends, she suddenly went missing in 1987, with Rosemary claiming she had gone to Wales to be with a lesbian partner.</p><p>The couple would joke to their other children that they would “end up under the patio like Heather” if they misbehaved. This, and their changing stories, led to the search warrants for the property, and subsequently to their arrests.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfa4Z6hI9ucGieopqxbsPErKtmqp%2Bosm651KubnqpdmLWquMOrnKdlm565rbHRrGSdp5Oquqa605qpsmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffred-west-rose-murder-children-killers-documentary.html&text=Who%20was%20Fred%20West%20and%20how%20did%20he%20die%3f%20%20The%20Sun&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffred-west-rose-murder-children-killers-documentary.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffred-west-rose-murder-children-killers-documentary.html&title=Who%20was%20Fred%20West%20and%20how%20did%20he%20die%3f%20%20The%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffred-west-rose-murder-children-killers-documentary.html&title=Who%20was%20Fred%20West%20and%20how%20did%20he%20die%3f%20%20The%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffred-west-rose-murder-children-killers-documentary.html&title=Who%20was%20Fred%20West%20and%20how%20did%20he%20die%3f%20%20The%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffred-west-rose-murder-children-killers-documentary.html&description=Who%20was%20Fred%20West%20and%20how%20did%20he%20die%3f%20%20The%20Sun" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./callie-day-thqc-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Callie Day (Opera Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ellie-taylor-strictly-come-dancing-comedian-actress.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Ellie Taylor? | The Sun">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
