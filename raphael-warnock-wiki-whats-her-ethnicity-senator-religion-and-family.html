He was formerly the head pastor of Douglas Memorial Community Church. Raphael Gamaliel Warnock is an American priest and politician who serves as a junior United States senator.</p><p>Since January 20, 2021, the Georgia native has been a Democrat Party member. Warnock was one of the first Democrats elected to the United States Senate from Georgia. He took office on January 5, 2021. Raphael is also the first African American senator from his hometown. On December 6, 2022, he faced off against Republican contender Herschel Walker in a runoff election. Many people are curious about the senator’s religious beliefs. As a result, this is all we know about Warnock’s faith.</p><h2>Raphael Warnock Religion: Is US Senator Raphael Warnock Christian Or Jewish?</h2><p>Raphael Warnock is a firm believer in Christianity.&nbsp;Since 2005, Warnock has served as the lead pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. He was formerly the head pastor of Douglas Memorial Community Church.&nbsp;Warnock gained to popularity in Georgia politics as a significant participant in the drive to expand Georgia’s Medicaid program as part of the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp;The senator started his career as a minister after receiving his Ph.D. Senator Warnock has long served as the lead pastor of Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church.&nbsp;In the history of the ancient church, he is the youngest pastor to be appointed for that position.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Raphael-Warnock-1.jpg alt="Raphael Warnock" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Raphael Warnock’s Family and Educational History</h2><p><strong>Raphael Warnock</strong> was born on July 23, 1969, in Savannah, Georgia.&nbsp;His parents, Verlene and Jonathan Warnock greeted the United States Senator. He is the eleventh of his parents’ twelve children and grew up in poor housing. His father is a preacher and a little businessman. Waycross, Georgia is Warnock’s hometown. The politician’s mother and father were Pentecostal ministers, according to WSAV.</p><p>Furthermore, Jonathan served in the United States Army during WWII.&nbsp;He learned welding and vehicle mechanics while in the army. He afterward started a modest auto restoration company.&nbsp;In terms of his educational history, Warnock graduated from Sol C. Johnson High School in 1987.&nbsp;Raphael attended Morehouse College and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in psychology in 1991, wanting to follow in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr.&nbsp;Following that, the senator acquired master’s and doctorate degrees in philosophy from Union Theological Seminary, which is connected with Columbia University.</p><h2>Raphael Warnock’s Wife & Children</h2><p>Warnock married Oulèye Ndoye on February 14, 2016. In a public ceremony, the Warnock-Ndoye couple married. They had already conducted a private ceremony in January of the same year. The couple has two children: a girl named Chloe and a boy named Caleb. The senator and his lady love had broken up. They split up in November 2019. The cause for their split is unclear.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Raphael-Warnock-2.jpg alt="Raphael Warnock" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Raphael Warnock’s ex-wife accused him in March 2020 of driving over her foot with his automobile.&nbsp;The claims were disputed by the politician. Furthermore, no redness, swelling, or fractured bones were discovered, hence the senator was not charged with any offenses.&nbsp;The divorce of Raphael Warnock and Oulèye Ndoye was completed in 2020. Let us hope that the politician’s children have equal time with both of their parents as they grow up.</p><p>In February 2022, the senator’s ex-wife asked the court to alter their child custody arrangement, giving her greater care of their two children so she could finish a Harvard University program. She also asked that child support payments be recalculated.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipmqiYlrKtedaaqaenk6B6uLXKomSwoJGpwG60xKtknqyYo7aktdOyZKydnpbBsL6Mq5yloZeevK95wKebZp6RoratxY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fraphael-warnock-wiki-whats-her-ethnicity-senator-religion-and-family.html&text=Raphael%20Warnock%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20Her%20Ethnicity%3f%20Senator%20Religion%20And%20Family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fraphael-warnock-wiki-whats-her-ethnicity-senator-religion-and-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fraphael-warnock-wiki-whats-her-ethnicity-senator-religion-and-family.html&title=Raphael%20Warnock%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20Her%20Ethnicity%3f%20Senator%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fraphael-warnock-wiki-whats-her-ethnicity-senator-religion-and-family.html&title=Raphael%20Warnock%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20Her%20Ethnicity%3f%20Senator%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fraphael-warnock-wiki-whats-her-ethnicity-senator-religion-and-family.html&title=Raphael%20Warnock%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20Her%20Ethnicity%3f%20Senator%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fraphael-warnock-wiki-whats-her-ethnicity-senator-religion-and-family.html&description=Raphael%20Warnock%20Wiki%3a%20Whats%20Her%20Ethnicity%3f%20Senator%20Religion%20And%20Family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./charlotte-lawrence.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charlotte Lawrence">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lana-del-rey-dating-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lana Del Rey dating history: Who has the Margaret singer dated?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
