The former Fear Factor host is also trained in karate, wrestling, Muay Thai, and boxing.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He is especially known in the martial arts world for the power of his kicks. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a viral YouTube video</a>, which has been viewed over 13 million times, Joe shows off the power of&nbsp;his rotation&nbsp;and the ballet precision angle of his leg.&nbsp;</p><p>First, you see his foot make contact with the punching bag, and then you hear the smack. No untrained person wants to be kicked by Joe Rogan and if you do, well — more power to you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joe Rogan has been studying martial arts since the age of 13.</h2><p>Wrestling and karate came to Joe as a way to build self-confidence and discipline in his teen years. From the outside looking in, these early arts seemed to have created a trajectory for his future martial arts practices, paving&nbsp;the way for a Rogan-esque balance: the&nbsp;body hits of Taekwondo and the grappling skills of Jiu-Jitsu.&nbsp;</p><p>At 15 years old, Joe made the transition from karate to Taekwondo. He rose the ranks&nbsp;quickly, receiving his black belt within the&nbsp;year, this according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his website’s bio.</a> From the ages of 15 to 19, he was the Massachusetts Full Contact Taekwando Champion holder.&nbsp;</p><p>At the age of 19, he also won the US Open Tae Kwan Do Championship, first in the lightweight division, then going on to defeat&nbsp;both the middle and heavyweight champs to take the Grand Championship.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">It was Joe's martial arts friends who convinced him to pursue comedy.</h2><p>Joe trained, competed, and taught in the mixed martial arts world for seven years, but that wasn't the only thing he had going. During training breaks at the Taekwondo gym in Boston he went to, Joe would goof off with&nbsp;his friends. They remarked on&nbsp;how&nbsp;funny he was, enough to convince him to get on stage.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He soon decided to stop competing. As he said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Belt magazine</a> in 2002 about stand-up and competing, "...as far as competition, there was no way I could do both.” However, Joe never stopped training.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As it turns out, the focus and confidence he gained from martial arts helped&nbsp;prepare him for the stage.</p><p>"I mean, what’s the worst thing that’s gonna happen — they’re not gonna laugh? Whatever!... With fighting, you put your life on the line. It’s a lot more difficult," Joe explained. He also noted how fighters can make for great comedians because of their desensitization to some of the more shocking aspects of fighting. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joe went on to train in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, earning his second black belt.</h2><p>After being out of the arena for six years, Joe discovered Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu after witnessing Royce Gracie win the 1994 UFC championship. He studied under Royce’s cousin Carlson Gracie.&nbsp;</p><p>In case you don't know, the Gracie family is one of the most, if not the most, prominent families in Brazilian jiu-jitsu. The first Gracie emigrated from Scotland to Brazil in 1801, but it wasn’t until the third generation that Carlos Gracie was taught Judo by Mitsuyo Maeda.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Carlos then went on to adapt the Judo style to incorporate more floor work as opposed to throws. In 1925, Carlos and his brother Oswaldo founded the Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Academy.&nbsp;</p><p>To be trained by a Gracie is to learn BJJ&nbsp;straight from the brain. It took Joe quite a while to receive his black belt in jiu-jitsu, remaining at a brown belt for eight years.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In 2012, he finally received his black belt in 10th Planet Jiu-Jitsu. His first black belt was given to him by Eddie Bravo and then subsequently with a Gi (a martial arts uniform) by Jean Jacques-Machado.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Today, Joe is focused on his podcast, not power kicks.</h2><p>Joe Rogan continues to train and frequently discusses MMA on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience.&nbsp;Listening and watching the man is enough to get a good sense of his strength, but to truly understand it&nbsp;one would have to dedicate themselves the way Joe has throughout his life to martial arts practices — and to those roundhouse kicks!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7ymedGonpqmXZe5oq%2FKZpmepKQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoe-rogan-black-belt.html&text=Joe%20Rogan%20Has%20More%20Than%20One%20Black%20Belt%20in%20Martial%20Arts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoe-rogan-black-belt.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-rogan-black-belt.html&title=Joe%20Rogan%20Has%20More%20Than%20One%20Black%20Belt%20in%20Martial%20Arts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoe-rogan-black-belt.html&title=Joe%20Rogan%20Has%20More%20Than%20One%20Black%20Belt%20in%20Martial%20Arts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoe-rogan-black-belt.html&title=Joe%20Rogan%20Has%20More%20Than%20One%20Black%20Belt%20in%20Martial%20Arts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoe-rogan-black-belt.html&description=Joe%20Rogan%20Has%20More%20Than%20One%20Black%20Belt%20in%20Martial%20Arts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kylie-jenner-shows-off-her-carved-pumpkins-8379614.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kylie Jenner Shows Off Her Carved Pumpkins">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./drew-gilpin-faust.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Drew Gilpin Faust">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
