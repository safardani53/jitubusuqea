Although Lamar and Joe had their differences in life, in death, all was forgiven.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Lamar's Message Of Gratitude and Love</h2><p>The message he posted on the social platform began with a thank you note for his fans. He was thankful for the love and prayers that they sent in such testing times. He noted his appreciation for every single one who sent him "positive energy" in the last two weeks.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But this message was truly about love and letting that love find expression. Lamar realized how life is not promised, and one does not have forever right their wrongs or mend bridges.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite differences, the former NBA athlete shared that he loved his father, and his father loved him. This much was understood between the two. But in the paragraphs immediately after, he encouraged fans to make good with their friends,&nbsp;family, and the people they care about sooner rather than later. He added:</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Tell someone you love them, smile a little more, laugh out loud, give your heart to those that deserve it because NOTHING is promised but death. That’s it.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Closing off, he thanked Karlie Redd for getting a painting of him and his dad made and for always being there for him as a friend. The painting also followed these heartfelt words into the post.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Joe Passed Away Mid-April</h2><p>Lamar had revealed Joe's death via an Instagram post on April 20, 2021. Even then, Lamar reminded fans that the most&nbsp;critical and formative relationships one can ever have would be with family.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Joe had also made a few appearances on Keeping Up With The Kardashians back when Lamar was dating Khloe Kardashian. Inductively, he was also on the spin-off&nbsp;Khloe & Lamar.</p><p>The basketball player's late father struggled with drug addiction for the better part of his life. Long-time viewers of the reality series will remember that these problems often manifested into their relationship. Even so, Lamar has not disclosed Joe's cause of death.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Joe's death left Lamar orphaned. His mother,&nbsp;Cathy Mercer, <a href=# rel=follow>died of colon cancer</a> when he was a twelve-year-old. In an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with DJ Vlad earlier this year, the socialite recalled the tragic incident.&nbsp;</p><p>He confessed that after he found out that his mother had died, he spent the whole night playing basketball in a nearby park. In fact, that was the first time he was allowed to stay out all night.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Much like his father, though, he has also had a fair share of drug-related problems, namely a <a href=# rel=follow>near-fatal overdose</a> in 2015. He has turned his life around, though, and has been California sober since the overdose.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiqqaeiqcBwuMCmmKtln5m8rnnDnpitoF2brq61y7JloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2flamar-odom-death-family-html.html&text=Lamar%20Odom%20Posts%20a%20Tribute%20to%20His%20Father%20Weeks%20after%20His%20Death%3a%20%27%20Knew%20He%20Loved%20Me%20and%20I%20Loved%20Him%27&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flamar-odom-death-family-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2flamar-odom-death-family-html.html&title=Lamar%20Odom%20Posts%20a%20Tribute%20to%20His%20Father%20Weeks%20after%20His%20Death%3a%20%27%20Knew%20He%20Loved%20Me%20and%20I%20Loved%20Him%27" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2flamar-odom-death-family-html.html&title=Lamar%20Odom%20Posts%20a%20Tribute%20to%20His%20Father%20Weeks%20after%20His%20Death%3a%20%27%20Knew%20He%20Loved%20Me%20and%20I%20Loved%20Him%27" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2flamar-odom-death-family-html.html&title=Lamar%20Odom%20Posts%20a%20Tribute%20to%20His%20Father%20Weeks%20after%20His%20Death%3a%20%27%20Knew%20He%20Loved%20Me%20and%20I%20Loved%20Him%27" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flamar-odom-death-family-html.html&description=Lamar%20Odom%20Posts%20a%20Tribute%20to%20His%20Father%20Weeks%20after%20His%20Death%3a%20%27%20Knew%20He%20Loved%20Me%20and%20I%20Loved%20Him%27" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ryan-oconnor-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ryan OConnor (ice hockey)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lizzy-caplan-parents-ethnicity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Get To Know Lizzy Caplans Parents, Siblings, And Ethnicity">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
