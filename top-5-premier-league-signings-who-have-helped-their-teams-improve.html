The competition is fierce, and the scrutiny is stringent. When players are transferred between Premier League clubs, they are under a lot of pressure. Fans can become bitter at times, and it can be difficult for many players to perform at their best due to a broken heart.</p><p>When clubs bring in foreign players who are not known as world-class, it is often difficult for them to become fan favorites. Despite the odds, some of them can rise above and establish their distinct identity.</p><p>Some Premier League players have helped their clubs’ fortunes.<br>Many new Premier League signings have performed admirably for their respective clubs. Their contribution to their new outfit has garnered valuable praise from both the gaffer and the fans. Some of them brought a solid personality to their team, others a fighting spirit, and still, others were the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle.</p><p>Here are five Premier League signings who have made a significant difference in their teams:</p><h2>Number 5: Hwang Hee-chan</h2><p>Nuno Espirito Santo was a huge presence at Wolverhampton Wanderers during his time there. He assisted the club in gaining promotion to the Premier League, remaining in the top flight, and even finishing in the Europa League spots. Bruno Lage had a lot of expectations to meet, and he was always going to need a very dependable man on his side.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Hwang-Hee-chan.jpg><p><strong>Hwang Hee-chan</strong> arrives to answer his gaffer’s call and step up in a time of need. The South Korean is on loan from RB Leipzig and has given Raul Jimenez, who has been the main man in the past, some much-needed breathing space.</p><p>A traditional box-to-box striker, his excellent ball control and ability to carry the ball from deep has added another dimension to Wolves’ attack in the Premier League. Without Hwang, the new manager would not have been able to perfect his strike partnership strategies.</p><p>The Korean forward has made a habit of bursting past the defense and has been a dangerous threat to the opposing backline. With four goals in eight games, he is Wolves’ top Premier League scorer. It is an honor to have a chant created for you in British football, and for an on-loan player to be bestowed with the same, he must be a huge hit.</p><p>“He’s Korean; he’s only on loan for a season; we all think he’s brilliant; he’s Hwang Hee-chan,” the Wolves fans have said of the striker. The chant was first heard before the international break in a Premier League game against Crystal Palace.</p><h2>Number 4: Marc Cucurella</h2><p>After the way things have turned out for <strong>Marc Cucurella</strong>, Barcelona looks stupid. La Masia provided them with a free and fabulous heir to Jordi Alba, but they passed him up in favor of foreign talent. Cucurella and the aforementioned foreign talent, Junior Firpo, are now both in the Premier League, and the former has been singled out for praise on numerous occasions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Marc-Cucurella-.jpg><p>Last summer, Barcelona sold the La Masia graduate to Getafe for €12 million, and Brighton signed him this time for his €18 million release clause. Cucurella has been a bright spark for Brighton on the left flank since his arrival. When in possession of the ball, he has been calm and astute, not making rash decisions.</p><p>The Spaniard believes in his ability to run up and down the flanks, which allows him to contribute significantly in the final third. Cucurella delivers crosses at a rate of 3.33 per 90 minutes. His work rate off the ball has been crucial for Brighton, as he has made 41 Premier League recoveries.</p><p>The Seagulls are notorious for underperforming in the final third. Graham Potter has them playing fluid football like the Premier League’s top sides, but they are struggling to meet their xG. Cucurella’s contribution could have been even greater if the strikers had been more precise with their finishing.</p><h2>Number 3: Maxwel Cornet</h2><p>Sean Dyche and Burnley’s 4-4-2 playing style in the Premier League is less about glitz and grace and more about the team’s rugged character. The Clarets are a team that enjoys playing with great physicality and asserting their dominance in the air. As a result, adding <strong>Maxwell Cornet</strong> to a team like this was always going to be an exciting prospect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Maxwel-Cornet.jpg><p>The former Lyon man has emerged as one of the season’s steals, putting in match-winning performances. Burnley has come out with some crucial points in every game Cornet has scored in, and for a team in the relegation zone, they have been valuable.</p><p>In his first start for the Clarets, he scored a stunning volley away at Leicester City. Burnley earned a point thanks to his brace against Southampton. When Sean Dyche’s team defeated Brentford at Turf Moor, the Ivorian struck again. Cornet’s pace on the left wing has worried any full-back who has come up against him.</p><p>The left-footed player is a ferocious ball-striker, and Burnley has been desperate for a winger of his caliber for a long time. His ability to challenge defenders has been critical to his success in the final third, and his dazzling footwork is a joy to watch.</p><p>Cornet scored four of Burnley’s 11 Premier League goals in six games. Undoubtedly, he could be the difference between Burnley’s relegation and survival at the end of the season.</p><h2>Number 2: Aaron Ramsdale</h2><p>The fact that most Arsenal fans have changed their minds after being perplexed by <strong>Aaron Ramsdale</strong>‘s signing demonstrates how much he’s improved the Gunners. The English goalkeeper’s start at the Emirates has been so good that he has already been compared to David Seaman.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Aaron-Ramsdale.jpg><p>When the goalkeeper, who had previously faced Premier League relegation with AFC Bournemouth and Sheffield United, first arrived at the Emirates, it seemed unjustifiable to most. He could have brought the curse to an already struggling Arsenal team. But Ramsdale brought tenacity, passion, character, and an unbreakable spirit.</p><p>Arsenal’s defense appears to be much more lively than it has been in recent years in the Premier League. There is great communication, fist bumps, and shouting at one another, and Ramsdale is at the center of it all. The new Gunner is outspoken, asserts himself, and has given them a significant psychological advantage intense situations.</p><p>But that isn’t all. His performances between the sticks on the field have demonstrated why no one ever misses Emi Martinez. Arteta prefers his team to play from the back, and Ramsdale’s back-to-back distribution has been flawless. In the Premier League, he has played 46 accurate long balls, a number that few midfielders can match.</p><p>Only Ederson and Edouard Mendy (6) have kept more Premier League clean sheets than Ramsdale (5), and the latter has played two fewer games. He has only given up four goals and made 25 saves in eight games. With the save of the season so far, he kept James Maddison’s free kick out against Leicester. He appears to be an excellent investment.</p><h2>Number 1: Conor Gallagher</h2><p>You can spot a gem when you see one, and the fact that <strong>Conor Gallagher</strong> is on the rise is no longer a secret. After each of his Premier League performances, the Chelsea loanee has received more and more praise. He has appeared to be a confident and well-rounded central midfielder capable of playing both offensive and defensive roles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Conor-Gallagher.jpg><p>Gallagher has been Crystal Palace’s focal point whenever they look to move the ball up the pitch. After a loan spell with West Brom last season, the 21-year-old has adapted well to the rigors of the Premier League. Patrick Vieira is using his massive reserves of stamina and work rate to help him press higher and make deep runs.</p><p>He’s made 65 recoveries in the middle of the park, demonstrating his willingness and hunger to get his team back on track. Gallagher has four Premier League goals and two assists in 10 Premier League appearances for the Eagles. This season, he also has the fifth-most shot-creation actions in the Premier League.</p><p>On defense, he has blocked five shots, made seven interceptions, and cleared a total of 13 balls. The midfielder has been everywhere on the field, assisting Vieira’s team to victory. Crystal Palace fans adore him, and his Premier League performances have earned him the Eagles’ Player of the Month award twice.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirqKhdanqxvsSmoJ6qXaGyorPUnmSsoZejtq%2Bz0mauoaddna63sYyhnKWolZl6tbTEoqlmrJWWurR5yKanq6emmnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftop-5-premier-league-signings-who-have-helped-their-teams-improve.html&text=Top%205%20Premier%20League%20Signings%20Who%20Have%20Helped%20Their%20Teams%20Improve&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftop-5-premier-league-signings-who-have-helped-their-teams-improve.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftop-5-premier-league-signings-who-have-helped-their-teams-improve.html&title=Top%205%20Premier%20League%20Signings%20Who%20Have%20Helped%20Their%20Teams%20Improve" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftop-5-premier-league-signings-who-have-helped-their-teams-improve.html&title=Top%205%20Premier%20League%20Signings%20Who%20Have%20Helped%20Their%20Teams%20Improve" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftop-5-premier-league-signings-who-have-helped-their-teams-improve.html&title=Top%205%20Premier%20League%20Signings%20Who%20Have%20Helped%20Their%20Teams%20Improve" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftop-5-premier-league-signings-who-have-helped-their-teams-improve.html&description=Top%205%20Premier%20League%20Signings%20Who%20Have%20Helped%20Their%20Teams%20Improve" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jo-koy-5-things-to-know-about-the-2024-golden-globes-host.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Jo Koy? 5 Things to Know About the 2024 Golden Globes Host">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./rachel-mcadams-best-quotes-about-motherhood.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Rachel McAdams Best Quotes About Motherhood">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
