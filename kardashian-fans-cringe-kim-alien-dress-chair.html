(sic)."</p><p>Another person said: "I hope she’s just making fun of herself and not hinting that she’s going to release furniture," to which another Reddit user replied: "I think that’s exactly what she was doing. Her lack of a caption just didn’t drive the joke through."</p><p>A different person noted: "That piece of furniture looks very uncomfortable."</p><p>Another harsh critic commented: "Kim has some style, but she is not creative at all."</p><p>However, other fans praised Kim for her latest look and described it as "stunning" and "beautiful".</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>"Hottest thing under the sun," one of her Instagram followers wrote.</p><p>"So beautiful," a second wrote, while a third simply added: "I love it."</p><p>Kim's latest post came hours after fans of <a href=#>The Kardashians</a> slammed her for some <a href=#>comments she made</a> in the latest episode of the Hulu series.</p><p>Episode four of season two saw Kim get upset over the backlash she received over something she previously said to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a> magazine about women not working hard enough.</p><p>Earlier this year, the&nbsp;<a href=#>mom-of-four came under fire</a>&nbsp;when she gave some pretty harsh advice during an&nbsp;<a href=#>interview and cover shoot</a>&nbsp;with the publication.</p><p>At the time, the&nbsp;<a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>&nbsp;alum said: “I have the best advice for women in business. Get your f**king a** up and work.”</p><p>“It seems like nobody wants to work these days," Kim continued</p><p>After her mom&nbsp;<a href=#>Kris Jenner</a>&nbsp;and sister&nbsp;<a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a>&nbsp;agreed with Kim’s statement, she added: “You have to surround yourself with people that want to work.</p><p>“Have a good work environment where everyone loves what they do because you have one life.</p><p>“No toxic work environments and show up and do the work.”</p><p>The latest episode of&nbsp;<a href=#>The Kardashians</a>&nbsp;saw Kim fret about the backlash she had received over the comments - but she refused to apologize and said she had simply been misunderstood.</p><p>During a lunch date with her other sisters,&nbsp;<a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a>, Kim said she was “usually so together” but was feeling “tested” lately.</p><p>“There’s just been so much going on because of that Variety interview, and it’s like I said what I said about people working," she explained to her siblings.</p><p>“Do I believe in that? Yes. I believe that you have to work hard in order to do that, but I was just so blindsided by how angry people got.”</p><p>She added: “Enough people were triggered so I want to be responsible and understand why people feel the way that they do and I do understand that.</p><p>“That some people aren’t given the same opportunities as us.”</p><h2>KIM'S INSPIRATION</h2><p>Kim then appeared to try and justify her comments and admitted that watching her momager <a href=#>Kris Jenner</a> juggle work with raising a family had inspired her.</p><p>"But I also feel like if people understood, that like yeah we grew up privileged and people don’t know the story of your [Kendall’s] dad [<a href=#>Caitlyn Jenner</a>] and mom having to sell their house in the Hills because they couldn’t afford it and they had to move to an apartment," she explained to her two sisters.</p><p>“And mom really started her career making money at 50, so it’s like growing up and seeing her hustle and seeing her get up every day with all these kids – six of hers that she had to take care of, I saw her work her a*s off and figure it out, get an agent’s license, get a manager license to figure out how to represent your dad and that really inspired me how to work," the Skims founder added.</p><p>And while discussing the reaction to her comments, Kim said in a confessional: “I think everyone would assume I got everything handed to me, being on a TV show.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“But being on a reality show, let alone a reality show girl with a sex tape does not open doors.</p><p>“And so I always felt like I had to work extra hard and harder to be taken seriously and for people to forget about my past.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/kim-kardashian-instagram-767909151.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/kardashian-fans-think-kim-breast-761093851.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/10/kim-kardashian-wears-silver-latex-720238845.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZGl%2Fcn6WaKKaqpSWwKm1wKdkn5meqHqkvsinnp5lm566bq3LopynZZSnsrS%2FjJyfmqGiZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkardashian-fans-cringe-kim-alien-dress-chair.html&text=Kardashian%20fans%20cringe%20at%20Kim%27s%20%27alien%27%20dress%20as%20it%20matches%20her%20chair%20leaving%20them%20hoping%20she%27s%20%27mak&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkardashian-fans-cringe-kim-alien-dress-chair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkardashian-fans-cringe-kim-alien-dress-chair.html&title=Kardashian%20fans%20cringe%20at%20Kim%27s%20%27alien%27%20dress%20as%20it%20matches%20her%20chair%20leaving%20them%20hoping%20she%27s%20%27mak" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkardashian-fans-cringe-kim-alien-dress-chair.html&title=Kardashian%20fans%20cringe%20at%20Kim%27s%20%27alien%27%20dress%20as%20it%20matches%20her%20chair%20leaving%20them%20hoping%20she%27s%20%27mak" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkardashian-fans-cringe-kim-alien-dress-chair.html&title=Kardashian%20fans%20cringe%20at%20Kim%27s%20%27alien%27%20dress%20as%20it%20matches%20her%20chair%20leaving%20them%20hoping%20she%27s%20%27mak" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkardashian-fans-cringe-kim-alien-dress-chair.html&description=Kardashian%20fans%20cringe%20at%20Kim%27s%20%27alien%27%20dress%20as%20it%20matches%20her%20chair%20leaving%20them%20hoping%20she%27s%20%27mak" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./michael-traynor-19751212-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michael Traynor (TV Actor) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp;
