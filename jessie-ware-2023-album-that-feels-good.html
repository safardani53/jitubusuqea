I don’t do this for the critical acclaim — I do it for my fans, but that doesn’t mean a bit of acclaim doesn’t feel very nice.”</p><p>Jessie was “excited” by the music she was making when she started That! Feels Good!</p><p>“Whenever you’re making a record, you are in your own world. I thought it was good but I wanted to know what everyone else thought,” she says.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE BIG INTERVIEWS">READ MORE BIG INTERVIEWS</h2><p>“Then when people embraced it so much, it was incredible. The critical acclaim and how the fans loved it was amazing.</p><p>“Tracks including Free Yourself, Begin Again, Pearls and the title track all make That! Feels Good! seem like you’re on the best night out.</p><p>&nbsp;“<a href=#>I’m a mum of three and my clubbing days are not as frequent as they used to be</a>. So, what I do is try to create a club on stage that I get to go to every night and also leave at a reasonable hour — it’s working perfectly for me.</p><p>“Begin Again was the first track we made for the album and it was over the internet on Zoom. It was a pain in the ass,” she admits.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Music</h2></p><p>“However, there was something there and I wanted to pick up where I left off with Remember Where You Are (the album closer for What’s Your Pleasure?).</p><p>“I wanted to feel like I was singing in the sun in <span id=ef504d67-af20-4fe0-8a11-efe3aa0f769e class=suggested-link>Brazil</span>, because it was miserable January or February in lockdown. I longed for this escapism.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘It brought me back to where I started in music’</h2><p>“This was the first session and it felt good. It was a great start. Then we had Free Yourself and that was pretty much the moment where I went for a tequila with coffee. That track really changed things for me.”</p><p>With a strong following from the <a href=#>LGBTQ community</a>, Jessie takes <a href=#>pride</a> on how diverse her crowds are.</p><p>She says: “The queer community has been incredibly good for me and I adore being so welcomed by them.</p><p>“One of the highlights of my year was playing Homobloc (queer night at Depot Mayfield) in Manchester. It was unbelievable. It was a new thing for me to do as I was doing a PA — which is just me, a DJ, and beautiful Homobloc dancers on stage.</p><p>“We had so much fun, and it brought me back to where I kind of started in music, which was being a dance vocalist, on the mic running around like a lunatic and trying to keep people dancing.</p><p>“I loved it and I love that I’m able to be in a beautiful, queer space like that where I get to rock up with a DJ and put on incredibly theatrical kind of Cabaret-esque shows.</p><p>“I feel so grateful. I have such a broad scope of fans,” she tells me. “If anybody came to my show, you’ll see the queer community there in abundance.</p><p>3And you’ll also see mums, daughters and sons coming maybe because they listen to the podcast (Table Manners that Jessie hosts with her mum Lennie).</p><p>“There’s an intergenerational quality to it too, which I love. For me, everyone’s welcome at my shows. And you’re DEFINITELY going to have a good time.”</p><p>Jessie is not long back from <span id=45224542-01aa-4637-b41f-6fc24fad82b5 class=suggested-link>Australia</span> where she played shows and festivals for the first time in more than a decade.</p><p>Now taking a well deserved break from performing, she says: “I’m really gutted I’m not on tour for a while now.</p><p>“But I’m really happy to get ahead with my gravy — I’m making Jamie Oliver’s ‘get-ahead gravy’ for <a href=#>Christmas</a> dinner. That is my plan for today. Let me just say night night to my son. I’m doing like ten things at the same time.”</p><p>Jessie is the master of juggling <a href=#>motherhood</a> with music and admits it’s tough. She explains: “My husband has been taking a lot for the team and I haven’t got the balance right yet – maybe one day, but by that point, it will probably be too late.</p><p>“My kids only travel with me if they are on half term, so it’s hard and when I’m home I wear the mum hat and I’m on the school runs.”</p><p>But even with having a lot on her plate at home, Jessie says: “I’ve had so many things to celebrate this year. Getting to Australia and selling out London’s Ally Pally twice.”</p><p>That! Feels Good! earned her a second <a href=#>Mercury Prize nomination</a> after her previous nod in 2012 for album Devotion.</p><p>“Oh yeah, I forgot about the Mercury,” she laughs. “It’s really cool. I was so thrilled for Ezra Collective when they won. And you get a prize anyway, a trophy so you kind of feel like you’ve won too.</p><p>“And it was such a great atmosphere and it’s hugely respected so I loved it.”</p><p>Jessie joined forces with James <span id=5150efc8-95ce-4ff5-998d-b435c166567b class=suggested-link>Ford</span> for the record — who she also worked with on What’s Your Pleasure? and her 2014 album Tough Love — as well as Stuart Price, who is known for his work with Madonna’s Confessions On A Dance Floor in 2005 as well as Kylie Minogue’s 2010s Aphrodite, <a href=#>The Killers</a> and <a href=#>Pet Shop Boys</a>.</p><p>“James and Stuart are sublime,” she says. “I’ve done the past few records with James, and we’ve worked together for over a decade now on and off,</p><p>“I love him. And I think we complement each other so, so much. And then Stuart was this new person that obviously has this reputation and is fantastic.</p><p>Stuart is on tour with <a href=#>Madonna</a> at the moment, musical-directing The Celebration Tour.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘The podcast is a beast but I love it’</h2><p>Jessie says: “When I worked with him, I felt like we were naughty school kids trying to be as over the top as possible.</p><p>“We’d look at each other, and giggle and have our hands in the air with songs. We were onto a winner as soon as we started work, so he’s welcome in my band any time.”</p><p>Another high point for the singer was working with <a href=#>Kylie </a>again after the two had collaborated on the single Kiss Of Life in 2021.</p><p>The album title track <span id=8b3cf58a-8ac0-41df-85a6-b3360dc94900 class=suggested-link>features</span> the Aussie star and the pair teamed up to play BBC’s <span id=d71c0e41-b887-4642-9745-3b2e447fc16f class=suggested-link>Radio</span> 2 in the Park in Leicester earlier this year.</p><p>She says: “I’ve definitely inherited a few fans from Kylie. And Kylie’s an absolute pro. I’m excited that she’s doing a Las Vegas residency. And her <a href=#>ITV</a> An Audience With (shown last weekend) looked like the best party ever. So yeah, Kylie is an inspiration and she’s also a really nice human being.”</p><p>Jessie’s enjoying a few weeks break before launcing into album No6 in the new year.</p><p>“I’m starting a new record,” she says proudly. “I will be in a studio from January and I’m very excited.</p><p>“There will be a lot of touring and festivals in the <span id=6cab0dde-7e88-41cd-ad9b-1e4bf7de53f8 class=suggested-link>summer</span>, maybe I’ll have some new music out then too.</p><p>“And the podcast carries on. It’s just a beast but I love it though it’s an absolute bugger to balance. But we’ve had Miriam Margolyes, <a href=#>Cher</a> and <a href=#>Princess Eugenie</a> who were all fantastic.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“Looking back I’ve done quite a lot in 2023. It’s been an amazing year and I feel really satisfied.</p><p>“I’m thrilled by it all to be honest. And now I feel like I’m able to give myself a bit of a rest.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/tour-credit-katie-collins-empics-860397262.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/NINTCHDBPICT000811588757.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jq2tmqaUqLWww8GisWhqZWaAdYSSb2ajnaOotqZ51pqpnmViZX90ecClma6lXam1osCMn5yepKNitLC7w2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjessie-ware-2023-album-that-feels-good.html&text=2023%20has%20been%20an%20amazing%20year%20%26amp%3b%20I%20feel%20really%20satisfied...%20now%20Im%20able%20to%20give%20myself%20a%20bit%20of%20a%20&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjessie-ware-2023-album-that-feels-good.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjessie-ware-2023-album-that-feels-good.html&title=2023%20has%20been%20an%20amazing%20year%20%26amp%3b%20I%20feel%20really%20satisfied...%20now%20Im%20able%20to%20give%20myself%20a%20bit%20of%20a%20" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjessie-ware-2023-album-that-feels-good.html&title=2023%20has%20been%20an%20amazing%20year%20%26amp%3b%20I%20feel%20really%20satisfied...%20now%20Im%20able%20to%20give%20myself%20a%20bit%20of%20a%20" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjessie-ware-2023-album-that-feels-good.html&title=2023%20has%20been%20an%20amazing%20year%20%26amp%3b%20I%20feel%20really%20satisfied...%20now%20Im%20able%20to%20give%20myself%20a%20bit%20of%20a%20" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjessie-ware-2023-album-that-feels-good.html&description=2023%20has%20been%20an%20amazing%20year%20%26amp%3b%20I%20feel%20really%20satisfied...%20now%20Im%20able%20to%20give%20myself%20a%20bit%20of%20a%20" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./beto-vega-19961121-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Beto Vega (Cantante de Msica Mundial) - Edad, cumpleaos, biografa, hechos, familia, patrimonio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./lupita-arellanos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lupita Arellanos  Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Husband, Career">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
