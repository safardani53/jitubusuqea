Kris dealt with major financial issues after getting divorced from Robert, but her life turned around when she got married to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Caitlyn Jenner</a>&nbsp;</strong>(then <strong>Bruce Jenner</strong>) and had two more kids, daughters <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kendall </strong></a>and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kylie</strong></a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Today, Kris is one of the most powerful women on the planet — but she<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> still regrets cheating on her first husband</a>. So, who did Kris have an affair with? Keep reading to find out that and more.</p><h2>Who Did Kris Jenner Cheat on Robert Kardashian With?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kris cheated on Robert with soccer player <strong>Todd Waterman&nbsp;</strong>in 1989. At the time, Kris was 33 and Todd was 23. Kris admitted to having an affair, which resulted in her and Robert getting divorced in 1991.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kris-jenner-affair-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>It’s unclear how Kris and Todd met. After the affair, Todd went on to become a Hollywood animator. He spoke about his relationship with the&nbsp;Keeping Up with the Kardashians star in an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a> in 2012. “The love swept us away. We made our own different reality. It was special, it was a little crazy, a little wild – we didn’t exercise caution or self-restraint. I think we were both very much in love,” he said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Todd also recalled how their affair was discovered after Robert hired private detectives to look into his wife’s relationship with the soccer player. ‘When he hired the private investigators I would say that’s when it started going bad. It was the midway point of the affair,” Todd said. He also explained he was worried Robert, a powerful lawyer who would eventually defend <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>O.J. Simpson </strong></a>in trial, would have him “wiped out” for sleeping with his wife.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“There’s several things I regret and it’s definitely the pain that it did cause Robert and the children specifically,” Todd also told Daily Mail about the affair. “I think it affected Kourtney the most. I know she was definitely affected and I always felt bad about that. She was the oldest. Kimberley didn’t seem to mind and Khloe she was just a special kid.”</p><h2>How Long Were Kris Jenner and Robert Kardashian Married?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Kris and Robert were married from 1978 to 1991. Kris was 22, and Robert was 34, when the couple tied the knot. During their marriage, they welcomed <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>four children</a> together: Kourtney (born in 1979), Kim (born in 1980), Khloe (born in 1984) and Rob (born in 1987). Kris and Robert got divorced in March 1991, but they stayed friendly until Robert’s death from esophageal cancer in 2003.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kris-jenner-affair-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>One month after her divorce from Robert, Kris married Caitlyn (then Bruce) in April 1991, and together they had two daughters: Kendall (born in 1996) and Kylie (born in 1997). <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kris and Caitlyn</a> announced their separation in October 2013 and finalized their divorce less than two years later. Kris has been dating <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Corey Gamble</a>&nbsp;</strong>since 2014.</p><h2>What Has Kris Jenner Said About Her Affair?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>Kris opened up about her affair with Todd in her 2011 memoir, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kris Jenner… and All Things Kardashian</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“That kiss was more than amazing; it was like a revival, a resuscitation, an awakening from some long, deep, unconscious sleep. I hadn’t been kissed like that in 10 years,” Kris wrote in her book. “It made me feel young, attractive, sexy, and alive. Along with these feelings came a wave of nausea. I actually wanted to throw up at the same time. Because it dawned on me that I had not felt that way with Robert for years.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/kris-jenner-affair-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>During an appearance on <strong>Diane Von Furstenberg’</strong>s podcast in March 2020, Kris called the cheating scandal her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“biggest regret” in life</a> and said that it “broke up my family.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>“I didn’t know what to do,” she said about the aftermath of <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the affair</a>. “I had four kids, I was single. I didn’t know where I was going to live, I didn’t know what I was going to do. I didn’t know how I was going to make a living. It was the scariest time to be that young. I was really, really scared.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Kris most recently opened up about her affair in a conversation with daughter Khloe on the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>October 26 episode</a> of&nbsp;The Kardashians. “I think being really young and dumb is something that plays into it because you don’t really understand the consequences of your actions,” Kris told the Good American co-founder.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>When Khloe asked if there’s anything her <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>late dad</a> did to make Kris cheat on him, the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>family matriarch</a> explained, “I don’t know because he was such a great husband and such a great dad, and I think that I fell into a situation where I thought that the grass was greener somewhere else. And I made a huge mistake. That’s like my life’s biggest regret.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmacmZl6rL7IrGSjnZ6jsrN5wqGcmqxdpLtuvs6bnKusXaCus7DArJ%2BimZ5ixKrAx2aYn56Rnr9usMStmKKko2KCcoSPaW9vZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-did-kris-jenner-cheat-on-robert-kardashian-with-affair-details-5180086.html&text=Who%20Did%20Kris%20Jenner%20Cheat%20on%20Robert%20Kardashian%20With%3f%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-did-kris-jenner-cheat-on-robert-kardashian-with-affair-details-5180086.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-did-kris-jenner-cheat-on-robert-kardashian-with-affair-details-5180086.html&title=Who%20Did%20Kris%20Jenner%20Cheat%20on%20Robert%20Kardashian%20With%3f%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-did-kris-jenner-cheat-on-robert-kardashian-with-affair-details-5180086.html&title=Who%20Did%20Kris%20Jenner%20Cheat%20on%20Robert%20Kardashian%20With%3f%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-did-kris-jenner-cheat-on-robert-kardashian-with-affair-details-5180086.html&title=Who%20Did%20Kris%20Jenner%20Cheat%20on%20Robert%20Kardashian%20With%3f%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-did-kris-jenner-cheat-on-robert-kardashian-with-affair-details-5180086.html&description=Who%20Did%20Kris%20Jenner%20Cheat%20on%20Robert%20Kardashian%20With%3f%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jurassic-world-dominion-everything-to-know-about-cast-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Jurassic World Dominion': Everything to Know About Cast, More">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./victoria-fuller-ethnicity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is BiP Star Victoria Fullers Ethnicity?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
