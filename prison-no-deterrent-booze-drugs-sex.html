Hidden away, there’s a magical mystery kingdom where life is good, and the term “<a href=#>cost of living crisis</a>” is as far-removed as a Narnian centaur.</p><p>Joy is abundant, sex is rampant, parties are a-happening and vodka is being sunk quicker than you can say “Grey Goose made me do it”.</p><p>Welcome to the British <a href=#>prison </a>service, 2023.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON PRISONS">READ MORE ON PRISONS</h2><p>As The Sun revealed yesterday, <a href=#>lags have been filmed necking shots</a>, doing drugs and snacking on trendy air fryer canapes.</p><p>One prisoner, probably not a future participant of Mastermind, uploaded the incriminating footage on to Snapchat.</p><p>The gang were enjoying high-end Ciroc and Grey Goose vodkas, Wray & Nephew Rum and smoking <a href=#>cannabis</a>.</p><p>As with any good house party (the house, in this instance, being <a href=#>HMP Five Wells</a> in Wellingborough, Northants) the music was blaring and revellers were dancing.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>A jolly time was had by all. No Dry Jan here, thank you very much.</p><p>Alarmingly, Five Wells — which only opened last year — is the future.</p><p>A Category C, all-male lock-up, it is the UK’s first privately run “smart prison”, and is very much seen by the Government as the national blueprint for rehabilitation.</p><p>Bright and airy rooms — they’re not called “cells”, as that’s mean — offer picturesque lakeside views, while windows do not have bars. Obviously it’s an “eco-jail”.</p><p>Residents — no “prisoners” in this holiday camp £253million jail — also enjoy use of sprawling football pitches, landscaped gardens and a state-of-the-art gym.</p><p>My university halls, admittedly the most disgusting on campus, were far, far more prisony than this. And my crime? Reading Thomas Hardy.</p><p>Of course, one of the biggest deterrents of jail was traditionally the lack of sex on tap for offenders.</p><p>That’s not an issue nowadays.</p><p><a href=#>iPhones </a>and Androids run rampant from cell to cell. Prisoners can watch porn until their little hearts are content. Bless.</p><p>Failing that, they can have <a href=#>sex </a>IRL — because, it turns out, prison is the new Tinder.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/former-prison-officer-corinne-redhead-740994353.jpg><p>In November, a female prison officer was jailed following a year-long affair with an inmate.</p><p><a href=#>Corinne Redhead</a>, a supervisor at the unfortunately named HMP The Mount, even gave birth to robber Robert O’Connor’s son before being imprisoned for 25 months for misconduct.</p><p>Elsewhere<a href=#>, three more female prison officers have been locked up following in-cell affairs</a> at Wrexham’s HMP Berwyn in North Wales.</p><p>This is another “flagship” jail, opened with much fanfare, in 2017.</p><p>It has since been described as the UK’s cushiest, with more mobiles, booze, parties and sex than you can shake a baton at.</p><p>The Ministry of Justice last week confirmed that more than 500 members of staff at Berwyn have undergone “corruption prevention”. (That horse, I may suggest, has well and truly bolted, lads.)</p><p>Either way, these snazzy new prisons might look the part...but they’re not working.</p><p>Prisoner numbers have almost doubled since the Nineties as tough sentencing outstripped the number of jail places, leaving the Government to cram the 85,000-strong prison population into buildings originally designed to hold about 65,000.</p><p>And last year a quarter of offenders leaving custody in England and Wales reoffended after their release.</p><p>It’s time, surely, to get tough.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Boring Kate is great</h3></p><p>HAPPY birthday, Kate Middleton!</p><p>And Prince Harry certainly ensured her special day yesterday got off to a flier.</p><p>Poor Kate has been portrayed as a surly faced, white-knuckled, old-before-her-time sourpuss by her brother-in-law.</p><p>She and William come across as those ruddy-cheeked gimps at school who told tales and shot their hand up before the teacher had even finished the question.</p><p>Kate has deputy head girl energy radiating from her every pore.<br>Wills, meanwhile, sounds like he never got a detention in his life.</p><p>He also almost single-handedly caused a constitutional crisis by trying to ban Harry’s wedding day beard.</p><p>That being said, what do we want from our future King and Queen?</p><p>There’s a reason they attend the Royal Variety Performance and aren’t up on stage themselves, cracking gags, whipping out a crowd-pleasing ditty or dancing with Diversity.</p><p>In a world of frantic distraction, heightened emotion and increasing, self-indulgent madness, isn’t a bit of stoic stability precisely what we need?</p><p>Yes, Kate and Wills might not now be my first choice guests at a dinner party (although kudos to the pair for apparently trying to switch the table seating plan at Meg and Harry’s wedding – we’ve all been there).</p><p>But in the face of attack after attack they’ve remained quietly detached, plodded on from community centre to community centre shaking hands and rictus-grinning for the cameras.</p><p>Quite simply, they have got on with the job at hand.</p><p>If anything, Harry has just given them the best bit of free PR imaginable.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Fat cat</h2><p>MY dog really needs to up her game.</p><p>Turns out <a href=#>Taylor Swift’s cat is worth £81million.</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/no-jared-usage-taylor-swift-449676398.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/clemmie-moodie-dog-dora-787433829.jpg><p>In stark contrast, Dora the miniature Dachshund is worth zero million and contributes precisely nothing to general household maintenance.

Taylor’s moggie, however, starred in the video for the singer’s smash hit Blank Space.</p><p>Olivia Benson, a Scottish Fold, now has Instagram fan pages and can command hundreds of thousands for a sponsored post.</p><p>In other animal news, the Belgian malinois has been found to be the planet’s most intelligent dog, following a study of 13 different breeds.</p><p>Scientists assessed 1,000 dogs by setting them seven cognitive and three behavioural tasks. It’s safe to assume Dora wouldn’t have had a single one of the 1,000 canines quaking in their coats.</p><p>My useless creature, for instance, was given an IQ test for Christmas.</p><p>Cover herself in glory, she did not.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>After trying to eat the box, one test – in which a towel is placed over the dog’s head in order to see how quickly it can navigate its way out (one to three seconds is “genius”, eight to ten seconds “remedial”) – Dora sat, unmoving, for 43 seconds.</p><p>Her future, I fear, is not bright.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Leaf it out, Vic</h3></p><p>WITH one two-syllable adjective, David and Victoria Beckham have confirmed what we all knew – tensions remain high with their daughter-in-law.</p><p>The couple, whose fractious relationship with Nicola Peltz has been widely documented, took to Instagram to wish her a happy birthday... both using the word “lovely” in their respective messages.</p><p>And EVERYONE knows (alongside “sweet” and “nice”) “lovely” is a code word for mild contempt.</p><p>“Hope you have a lovely day!”, chirruped VB, underneath a photo of Nicola, poor girl, with half her face covered up and chowing down on food.</p><p>Echoing his wife’s mildly passive aggressive sentiments, David posted the same message – this time above a photo of Nicola with some sort of giant leaf covering her entire face, minus an ear.</p><p>Over to you, Nic...</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ316hY9ybWlnoKe2tLvNZqWoZZSawaa%2B0Z6lrWWSpLy7sYydqa6fo2LApsSO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fprison-no-deterrent-booze-drugs-sex.html&text=Prison%20is%20no%20deterrent%20if%20our%20jailhouses%20rock%20with%20high-end%20vodkas%2c%20drugs%20and%20sex%20on%20tap&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fprison-no-deterrent-booze-drugs-sex.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fprison-no-deterrent-booze-drugs-sex.html&title=Prison%20is%20no%20deterrent%20if%20our%20jailhouses%20rock%20with%20high-end%20vodkas%2c%20drugs%20and%20sex%20on%20tap" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fprison-no-deterrent-booze-drugs-sex.html&title=Prison%20is%20no%20deterrent%20if%20our%20jailhouses%20rock%20with%20high-end%20vodkas%2c%20drugs%20and%20sex%20on%20tap" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fprison-no-deterrent-booze-drugs-sex.html&title=Prison%20is%20no%20deterrent%20if%20our%20jailhouses%20rock%20with%20high-end%20vodkas%2c%20drugs%20and%20sex%20on%20tap" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fprison-no-deterrent-booze-drugs-sex.html&description=Prison%20is%20no%20deterrent%20if%20our%20jailhouses%20rock%20with%20high-end%20vodkas%2c%20drugs%20and%20sex%20on%20tap" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-rob-bourdon-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Rob Bourdon Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./michelle-keegan-ditches-wedding-ring-for-revlon-event-despite-partying-with-mark-wrights-sisters.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Michelle Keegan ditches wedding ring for Revlon event... despite partying with Mark Wright's sisters">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
