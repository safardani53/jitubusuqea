Sure, you can eat salmon raw, but you need to be very careful about doing so — otherwise, you'll call up your parents in tears and worry you won't live to see another day.</p><p>OK, that's quite an exaggeration, but it's what Sandra of the <a href=#>TikTok</a> duo, Sandra and Twitt (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@twittandsandra</a>), did after her roommate, Twitt, told her that eating raw salmon wasn't the best idea.</p><p>Check out the full story below! Plus, stick around to hear what social media advised Sandra to do.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A woman called her dad in a panic after eating raw salmon for a week straight.</h2><p>"My roommate [is] telling her dad she's been eating raw salmon for the past week and didn't know it was wrong until I told her today," Twitt wrote in a text overlay of the now-viral video before sharing the chaotic story.</p><p>While on the phone with her dad, Sandra told him she had been "cutting off a slab of fish for the past week" and, well, eating it on a bagel with cream cheese. Sandra then recalled someone, presumably Twitt, asking her if she was eating sushi-grade salmon, to which she responded, "What's that?" At that point, we all knew it wasn't sushi-grade fish.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@twittandsandra href=#>@twittandsandra</a> <a title="♬ original sound - sandra&twitt" href=#>♬ original sound - sandra&twitt</a></figure><p>Twitt couldn't control her laughter, but she quickly pulled herself together long enough to explain the situation to her and Sandra's followers. As she continued giggling, Twitt told the viewers that Sandra had been eating raw fish for a week straight, and she was starting to panic</p><p>Twitt flipped the camera around to show a stressed AF Sandra, who was on the verge of tears while talking to her dad on the phone. As the video came to an end, Twitt reassured Sandra, telling her, "You're OK, You're fine, you don't [have to cry]." Ugh, what a sweet friend!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">TikTok users urged Twitt to take Sandra to the hospital ASAP.</h2><p>The viral video has been viewed more than 6 million times and counting as of this writing; it also received over 4,800 comments from fellow TikTokers who also couldn't help but laugh at Sandra's mistake.</p><p>"The fanning the tears away is sending me," one user hilariously commented, while a second person pointed out, "On the wooden cutting board, too." She wanted to keep it classy, obviously!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @hailseleiro</span></figure><p>"She was prob like, 'Why is everyone complaining it's expensive? I can buy one piece and eat it all week,’" a third user joked, and to be honest, we probably would've thought the same thing as Sandra.</p><p>Someone else added, "Thinking she's eating lox and bagels." However, another TikToker responded, "Even lox packages say, 'Discard three days after opening.' IDK how she's not sick after it being open a WEEK?"</p><p>A few others (including us) loved that Sandra's dad could be heard laughing on the phone; it's honestly such a typical parent reaction! Luckily, many fellow TikTokers let Sandra know she wasn't alone because they have made similar, or worse, mistakes when it comes to food.</p><p>"It's okay. In college, I was cooking bird food, thinking it was a blend of wild rice and quinoa," one user revealed.</p><p>A second TikToker disclosed, "It's okay, we really do so much in college we're all struggling. I bought food topper for my dog, and I accidentally seasoned my meat with it."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok / @preapocalypse</span></figure><p>On the other hand, most viewers advised Twitt to get Sandra some medical attention ASAP.</p><p>"I would go to the ER immediately," a TikTok user shared, while another person penned, "I'd be at the ER immediately for parasite pills." Yeah, that was probably the best thing to do at that point.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mnJqso2K%2FosOMrJilpZ%2BjeqSty6WqZpyRmQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwoman-eats-raw-salmon-calls-dad.html&text=Woman%20Calls%20Her%20Dad%20in%20a%20Panic%20After%20Eating%20Raw%20Salmon%20for%20a%20Whole%20Week&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwoman-eats-raw-salmon-calls-dad.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwoman-eats-raw-salmon-calls-dad.html&title=Woman%20Calls%20Her%20Dad%20in%20a%20Panic%20After%20Eating%20Raw%20Salmon%20for%20a%20Whole%20Week" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwoman-eats-raw-salmon-calls-dad.html&title=Woman%20Calls%20Her%20Dad%20in%20a%20Panic%20After%20Eating%20Raw%20Salmon%20for%20a%20Whole%20Week" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwoman-eats-raw-salmon-calls-dad.html&title=Woman%20Calls%20Her%20Dad%20in%20a%20Panic%20After%20Eating%20Raw%20Salmon%20for%20a%20Whole%20Week" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwoman-eats-raw-salmon-calls-dad.html&description=Woman%20Calls%20Her%20Dad%20in%20a%20Panic%20After%20Eating%20Raw%20Salmon%20for%20a%20Whole%20Week" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./4-year-old-falls-from-chairlift-at-ski-resort-in-montana-says-father.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="4-Year-Old Falls from Chairlift at Ski Resort in Montana, Says Father">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./russell-young.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Russell Young">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
