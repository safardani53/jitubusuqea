So it’s good to get yourself as sorted as possible with those tasks you CAN predict!</p><p>Our handy guide will help you pack what you need without overspending on stuff you don’t – it’s easy to think everything has to be shiny and freshly bought for your new baby, but it really doesn’t.</p><p>The NHS recommends getting your bag ready three weeks before your due date but, really, it’s never too soon.</p><p>Each year, around one in 13 UK babies are born before 37 weeks, so getting your bag prepared will mean you won’t have to panic if your little one decides to make an early appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/shutterstock_1092130664.jpg><p>You may want to get your bag ready around the start of the third trimester (that’s at 28 weeks) if you’re expecting multiples or have been told you may have to give birth earlier, which might happen if you have pre-eclampsia.</p><p><strong>But where exactly do you start?</strong></p><p>Chelsea Palmer-Taylor is expecting a son in January. Chelsea, who lives in Buckingham with her husband and their daughter Beatrix, two, says deciding what to pack can be overwhelming.</p><p>She says: “You’re often given an extensive list of things you need to pack in your hospital bag, which in my experience really aren’t necessary.</p><p>For NHS tips, advice and support at every stage of pregnancy and beyond, sign up to the really useful, free&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Start for Life emails</a>.

Any holdalls will do – you don’t need to buy anything specifically for the occasion.</p><p><strong>Here are our top 12 items for your bag:</strong></p><ul><li>A phone or tablet charger with an extra-long cable</li><li>Your birth plan, maternity notes and any medications you are taking</li><li>Maternity pads (panty liners won’t be sufficient). Whether you have a C-section or not, you’ll bleed for at least a few days if not a few weeks, so stash a couple of packs</li><li>Washbag with toothpaste, toothbrush, hairbrush, lip balm, deodorant, shower gel, shampoo and hairbands</li><li>Loose, comfortable clothes to wear during labour, plus a pair of slippers, sliders or maybe even just cheap/old flip flops you can also wear to the shower</li><li>Nightwear, which should be front-opening or loose-fitting, especially if you plan to breastfeed</li><li>Around three changes of easy to wear clothes, five or six pairs of knickers and two or three comfortable bras (including nursing bras, if you plan to breastfeed)</li><li>Breast pads – you might not need these until you leave hospital, but it’s good to pack a few with you. Whether you plan to breastfeed or not, you will have a few leaks when your milk first comes in (and if you do breastfeed, you’ll need them regularly until you stop)</li><li>Towel</li><li>Easy snacks and drinks</li><li>Bag to put washing in</li><li>A TENS machine if you want to try using one (but check it over and work out how to use it before you get to hospital)</li></ul><p>Charlotte Smith, 38, a support worker from Durham, is expecting her third boy in January. Charlotte says packing a hospital bag doesn’t have to cost the earth – and you really don’t need to take the kitchen sink.</p><p>She says: “Now in my third pregnancy, I’ve packed a fraction of what I took to hospital when I had my last two. I had tonnes of stuff before but didn’t even use half of it.</p><p>“I’ve got a few changes of clothes for me and my baby, and some snacks. I’m not even taking any make-up!</p><p>“Mums shouldn’t worry about forgetting things. At the end of the day, if you forget something, your partner can soon go home for it or you can ask a visitor to pop by with it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image1-1.jpeg><p>“My must-have was wireless headphones. They were a godsend last time on a busy maternity ward.”</p><p>While not essential, luxuries might include your own pillow, a fan or water spray to keep you cool, and books and magazines to help pass the time.</p><p><strong>Here are our top suggestions for your baby’s bag (in addition to the car seat):</strong></p><ul><li>Nappies –&nbsp;newborn/size 1 at this stage, unless you already know your baby will be larger or is expected to be premature</li><li>Hat – soft cotton</li><li>Vests – take five in case you’re in hospital for a while</li><li>Long-sleeved suits –&nbsp;as above</li><li>Pack of cotton wool or wipes</li><li>Muslin squares – these will be so useful in coming months!</li><li>A blanket or shawl – light cotton, not too heavy or woolly</li></ul><p>Encourage your partner to take a few items too.</p><p>Caroline Dear, 24, is a teacher and new mum from Bexley, Kent. Caroline recalls she had huge bags for her and her baby – but partner Stephen, 27, forgot to take anything.</p><p>She says: “Stephen got frustrated when we were in hospital for a few days as he didn’t even have a change of clothes.</p><p>“At the very least I’d get your partner to pack a change of clothes as well as a toothbrush and deodorant!</p><p>“I do wish I’d taken a towel too. While the hospital gave me one, it was tiny&nbsp;and got dirty very quickly.</p><p>“Packing a hospital bag doesn’t have to be expensive. I switched a lot of my toiletries into travel bottles beforehand and that saved me buying a whole new set for no reason, and saved on space!”</p><p>If you’re expecting to go to hospital by car, it’s also worth making sure it’s got enough petrol in the tank and that you have change or the right mobile app to pay for parking where you need it.</p><p>Oh and that you have your camera or phone&nbsp;(safely stashed somewhere by your other half, your mum or whoever will be with you), for taking lots of pictures of your bundle of joy and sharing the news with loved ones!</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">‘It is never too early to pack for hospital’</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/BOX_Marley_Hall_Portrait_236_07-1.jpg><p>Marley Hall, a midwife and a mum of five, says: “Packing a hospital or birth bag shouldn’t be an exhausting task and it’s never too early to start thinking about it.</p><p>“Even if you’re planning a home birth, having a bag ready in the event of a transfer into hospital is wise.
