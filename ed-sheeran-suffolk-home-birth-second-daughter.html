But the couple are understood to have confided only their very closest family about their pregnancy.</p><p>Ed has plenty of space on his property for his growing family, with a gym and pool, a tree house and even a separate bungalow.</p><p>However back in 2020, country life was not going so well for the hitmaker as his prize egg laying chickens were under attack from foxes.</p><p>A local insider revealed: “He’s lost a couple in recent weeks and they are not so easy to replace with the nation being in lockdown. So, he’s made sure their coop is doubly secure so he doesn’t lose his entire stock to foxes.</p><p>“Ed is very much in tune with nature and loves fresh produce from his gardens so he doesn’t want he lose any more of his girls to foxes.”</p><p>Also, his expansion of the property - dubbed Sheeranville - has ruffled a few feathers recently as neighbours complain about the constant works.</p><p>The mega-famous singer lost his fight to block his neighbour's extension next to his site.</p><p>Since buying his Grade II listed farmhouse seven years ago the multi-millionaire singer songwriter has put in as many planning applications as he’s had hits and has turned his pile into a mini-village dubbed Sheeranville.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000503160512.jpg><p>The Plus and Multiply star has everything from an orangery to a spiral wine cellar.</p><p>Ed, who shared the happy news that he is now a father-of-two, said that he wanted to expand his family.</p><p><a href=#>In an exclusive interview with The Sun</a>&nbsp;ahead of his most recent album last October, Ed said: “I’d love more kids man, I’d love it. But it does depend on what Cherry wants too because it’s her body.</p><p>“I’m really proud of Cherry as a mother. She’s such an incredible human, I’m just in awe.</p><p>“She did a whole Cambridge degree which she started two weeks before giving birth. I went to her graduation at Jesus College and people were saying like, ‘How did she do this with a baby?’”</p><p>Here is how Ed — who grew up in historic town Framlingham two miles away — has transformed the sleepy enclave into a millionaire’s playground and the perfect home for his family.</p><p><strong>1: A HUGE MODERN DETACHED FARMHOUSE</strong> is the estate’s main house. Bought in June 2012 for £895,000, it includes a billiards room and an additional “man cave” ­complete with recording studio and a jacuzzi.</p><p><strong>2: A 16TH CENTURY GRADE II LISTED FARMHOUSE</strong> was snapped up by Ed for £450,000 in the same year.</p><p><strong>3: A FOUR-BEDROOM HOME</strong> in front of his farmhouse was bought for £925,000 in September 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000502931291.jpg><p><strong>4: THE BUNGALOW</strong> close to his property went for a relative song at £525,000 in 2017.</p><p><strong>5: THE PUB</strong>, featuring a selection of beers, was granted planning permission in 2017 as long as he used bricks and tiles that were in-keeping with the original barn.</p><p>It features underground rooms with a 35ft by 20ft cinema and a 6ft wide tunnel to the main house.</p><p>Planning officials feared the pub’s 16ft sign saying The Lancaster Lock, to honour his wife Cherry Lancaster Seaborn, could undermine the “character” of the area, but later let him keep it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000502931466.jpg><p><strong>6:A TREE HOUSE</strong> measuring 26ft by 26ft has a living room, study and TV audio visual room. Dubbed a “Hobbit Hole” by some, it gives Ed and his pals views across the rolling hills.</p><p><strong>7: A MODERN EXTENSION</strong> to the main house features a gym and indoor pool, with changing room and outdoor seating. He knocked down a cart lodge to build it.</p><p><strong>8: FOUR-SPACE GARAGE</strong> which looks like a barn.</p><p><strong>9: AN OUTDOOR KITCHEN</strong>&nbsp; Ed wants to make to his country pile and have a four-and-a-half-foot high terracotta chimney pizza oven and two large barbecues next to the pub.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000474923737.jpg><p>Complete with high-end decking, a York stone bar and seating, it would be the ideal spot to wine and dine guests al fresco.</p><p><strong>10: A £500,000 “WILDLIFE POND”</strong>&nbsp;drew complaints from locals who alleged it was being used as a swimming pool as it had steps, handrail and a jetty.</p><p>Ed was allowed to keep the pond but the council ordered him to remove a nearby wooden caravan which had been converted into a sauna.</p><p>Another of his planning defeats was a wedding chapel he wanted to build for when he and Cherry married last year. Officials ruled the proposed 48ft-high Saxon style round tower would create “unsatisfactory visual impacts”.</p><p>The only way you’d know a man worth £160million lives in the village is the fleet of works’ vans parked up behind the large wooden fence that shields the complex, with deliveries taken from boutique furniture company Jayrest Interiors.</p><p>In fact locals in the pretty village of just 600 people say they haven’t seen their famous neighbour for weeks — and there was no sign of him when The Sun visited.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/NINTCHDBPICT000503160513-1.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN TV AND SHOWBIZ</h2></p><p>“We rarely see Ed round here at the moment,” one local said. But there’s so much construction work going on that he’s probably steering well clear.</p><p>“With all the money he has I find it strange that he’s not just gone out and spent a few million pounds on a mansion deep in the countryside.”</p><p>But another backed the singer, saying: “Good luck to the guy — at least he’s spending his hard-earned money with local builders and I am sure it will look lovely when it’s done.</p><p>“You can quite easily live here and not know that we’re home to one of the biggest stars in the music world.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Ed Sheeran stars in hilarious new Heinz Ketchup advert</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZWmGcoCOnptmq5iasrOtzWaqrp6WpLmseceopJ5lkp6%2FtbSMrJycp56ZeqWt1KCfrZ2iZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fed-sheeran-suffolk-home-birth-second-daughter.html&text=Inside%20Ed%20Sheeran%20and%20wife%20Cherrys%20incredible%203.7%20million%20Suffolk%20estate%20where%20theyre%20raisin&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fed-sheeran-suffolk-home-birth-second-daughter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fed-sheeran-suffolk-home-birth-second-daughter.html&title=Inside%20Ed%20Sheeran%20and%20wife%20Cherrys%20incredible%203.7%20million%20Suffolk%20estate%20where%20theyre%20raisin" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fed-sheeran-suffolk-home-birth-second-daughter.html&title=Inside%20Ed%20Sheeran%20and%20wife%20Cherrys%20incredible%203.7%20million%20Suffolk%20estate%20where%20theyre%20raisin" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fed-sheeran-suffolk-home-birth-second-daughter.html&title=Inside%20Ed%20Sheeran%20and%20wife%20Cherrys%20incredible%203.7%20million%20Suffolk%20estate%20where%20theyre%20raisin" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fed-sheeran-suffolk-home-birth-second-daughter.html&description=Inside%20Ed%20Sheeran%20and%20wife%20Cherrys%20incredible%203.7%20million%20Suffolk%20estate%20where%20theyre%20raisin" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./keanu-reeves-motorcycle-ride-los-angeles-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Keanu Reeves Goes For Motorcycle Ride In Los Angeles: Photos  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dave-chappelle-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dave Chappelles Net Worth, Family, and Why His Comedy Is so Controversial">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
