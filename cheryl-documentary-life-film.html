near-tragic accident.</p><p>Wesley said the song, from their album Brightside, was an ode to the pandemic too, telling fans: “We were really lucky to somehow walk away from that experience, and this song is based on that car wreck.</p><p>"But it’s also based on the last few years, when the world sort of shut down.”</p><p>The Colorado band played to a sold-out crowd in the capital’s St Anne’s Park on Friday, a stop on their huge Brightside World Tour.</p><p>They will play their biggest ever UK gig in London on July 8.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>FOOS, NOEL FIGHT</h2><p>NOEL GALLAGHER and

count his chart topping records with Oasis, while the Foos would bag their sixth No1 record.</p><p>Foo Fighters had last night sold 27,700 copies, while Noel has shifted 27,697.</p><p>A source said: “Noel and the Foos is gearing up to be the most exciting race to the top so far this year.</p><p>"Noel has a lot of fans in the UK but the Foos’ album is the first since their drummer Taylor Hawkins died and is seriously emotional.”</p><p>In even more surprising news, Kylie Minogue And Madonna may both have singles inside the Top 20 this Friday.</p><p>Kylie’s Padam Padam has rocketed to No6 from
