Based in Santa Monica, Calif., the movement attracted thousands of followers over its decades of existence. The group disbanded in 1991, and Dederich died in 1997, but its impact has continued to follow many of its former members as more attention has been brought to its sometimes violent control tactics.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Synanon founder Chuck Dederich and his wife Betty at a Western wedding in Born in Synanon.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Bruce Levine/Courtesy of Paramount+</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What is Synanon?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dederich originally founded Synanon in 1958 as a way to provide assistance to people addicted to drugs, since Alcoholics Anonymous did not provide assistance to other forms of drug addiction at the time, according to a 2018 Los Angeles Magazine <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>examination</a> of the cult.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The magazine reported that Synanon was a first-of-its-kind rehabilitation program that helped change the American public’s belief that drug addiction could be treated. However, Dederich’s grasp on the group and its followers began to become manipulative and violent.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The leader claimed members of the program needed to live on the compound in order to receive the proper help they needed. Members shaved their heads and wore similar clothing, and many displayed unquestioning obedience to Dederich despite his increasing brutality and violence, according to reporting by Los Angeles Magazine.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Men marching in practice for the upcoming Renaissance wedding in Born in Synanon.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Bruce Levine/Courtesy of Paramount+</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Who was its leader?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dederich, born in Toledo, Ohio in 1913, was an alcoholic by the time he was in high school, according to a New York Times <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>obituary</a> about the divisive cult leader. His problems continued throughout his life: He dropped out of Notre Dame after just 18 months because of poor grades amid his struggle with addiction. When he was 43, Dederich sought help from Alcoholics Anonymous and soon began hosting others addicted to both alcohol and other drugs at his apartment in Ocean Park, Calif.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The charismatic Dederich founded Synanon at a small storefront in Southern California and quickly began attracting more members. ''I say this with as much humility as I am capable, which isn't very much, but when I sit down and start to talk, people start gathering,'' Dederich once said in a 1980 deposition, according to the Times. ''It is inevitable.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dederich’s organization ultimately amassed $30 million in assets after attracting donations from around the country as word spread about the movement and its proclaimed ability to help addicts in need.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Betty Dederich, wife of Synanon's founder Chuck, shaving Kathy Sheehan Lewbell's head in Born in Synanon.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Bruce Levine/Courtesy of Paramount+</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What did Synanon’s followers believe in?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dederich and his movement’s core belief, according to the Times, was that drug addicts required tough love to overcome their struggles. The leader had viewed drug addicts as child-like and thus treated them with harsh discipline that ultimately became violent. Dederich would tell followers: “'Today is the first day of the rest of your life,” according to the Times, and believed that drug addiction could be treated — a core component of his recruitment campaign that attracted many of its followers.</p><p>But according to Los Angeles Magazine, Dederich also eventually claimed that if a follower left the group, then they would revert back to their addictions, thus allegedly trapping many in the group’s grasp. That grasp, many former members and critics have said, was an abusive one.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>A still from Born in Synanon.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Bruce Levine/Courtesy of Paramount+</p></span></figure><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What went wrong?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Part of Dederich’s methods for recovery included gatherings referred to as “the Synanon Game” in which members would be encouraged to scream aggressively, which often spilled over into actual physical violence, Cassidy Arkin, the former member and subject of Paramount+’s new series recently <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told</a> CBS News.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There were things that were not right,” Arkin said she realized after moving out of the compound. “I didn’t realize until I was much older how bad things had gotten.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Among those things, the Times reported that Dederich was sentenced to five years' probation after pleading no contest to conspiracy to commit murder after he and other members placed a rattlesnake in the mailbox of lawyer Paul Morantz, who had filed a lawsuit against the group. Morantz was bit and spent several days in the hospital, ultimately surviving the attack. After that, Dederich was banned from leading Synanon.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>What happened to Synanon?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Synanon officially disbanded in 1991 after the Internal Revenue Service cracked down on the group in the mid-1980s. A federal district judge had rejected the group’s claim to be a tax-exempt religion, according to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The New York Times</a>, ruling that the group engaged in fraud in an attempt to gain the tax benefit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Born in Synanon is available to stream on Paramount+.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Ouu6K6zqdkr6GfobKvwIycrKWsXZrFornIp5ydZaCWv6K5zq6lrWWUpLC2v8SroJ6rXW2BcoKPcXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsynanon-violent-cult-examined-paramount-docuseries-8416089.html&text=New%20Docuseries%20Examines%20Violent%20Cult&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsynanon-violent-cult-examined-paramount-docuseries-8416089.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsynanon-violent-cult-examined-paramount-docuseries-8416089.html&title=New%20Docuseries%20Examines%20Violent%20Cult" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsynanon-violent-cult-examined-paramount-docuseries-8416089.html&title=New%20Docuseries%20Examines%20Violent%20Cult" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsynanon-violent-cult-examined-paramount-docuseries-8416089.html&title=New%20Docuseries%20Examines%20Violent%20Cult" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsynanon-violent-cult-examined-paramount-docuseries-8416089.html&description=New%20Docuseries%20Examines%20Violent%20Cult" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tim-cook-partner-boyfriend-married-gay-family-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Proudest Gay Man Tim Cook's Sexuality, Boyfriend's Queries, Career &amp;amp; Net worth In Brief">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./donald-trump-jr.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Donald Trump Jr - Latest News &amp;amp; Stories - The US Sun">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
