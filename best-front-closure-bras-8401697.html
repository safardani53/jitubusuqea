And if you need a bra to create the illusion of a larger bust, you're in luck. This one is also available in AA sizes, making it great for those with smaller busts, too.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Band Sizes:</strong> 32-40 | <strong>Cup Sizes</strong>: AA-DD | <strong>Material: </strong>92% polyamide, 8% spandex | <strong>Colors</strong>: 21 |<strong> Underwire:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-small-busts-lulalu-mila-convertible-racerback-bra></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Small Busts</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lulalu Mila Convertible Racerback Bra</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lulalu Mila Convertible Racerback Bra" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/1byq3gY0-hjSbludvC9r3bhGRe4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lulalu--mila-convertible-racerback-bra-36c4ba4115d941ccbc8411b10addab69.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">AAA bras are real, and Lulalu's convertible racerback bra is living proof.

You've got options, from zippers to snaps (magnetic) to barrels, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">bra-fitting expert Katie Weir</a>. However, when in doubt, she recommends sticking with barrel closure bras as they provide extra security. “Opt for a barrel closure as this will give more security and ensure the bra doesn’t pop open which can happen with magnet closure styles,” she tells PEOPLE.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Fit&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As Weir points out, it's important to make sure a front-closure bra fits perfectly, which goes for all bras. “As with any bra, we want to make sure the breast tissue is contained within the cups without falling into the center of the bra,” she says. "We also want breast separation and no breasts rubbing together.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Materials</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to finding the best front-closure bras, materials are also an important consideration, as Sena states that since the bra needs to meet in the middle, you want a fabric that offers good stretch. “I would look for a microfiber with a higher percentage of elastane (microfiber is a blend of nylon for softness and elastane for stretch, and bras all contain different amounts of it),” she says.&nbsp;The <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Playtex 18 Hour Front-Close Wirefree Bra</a> is one example of a microfiber bra on this list.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Support&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like any other bra, support is key in a front closure bra, says Sena. “Support should always be the biggest consideration when purchasing any bra,” she explains. “For a bra with a front closure, you should look for some structure in the cups, so foam cups and an underwire are a good idea. Keep in mind that the band is not adjustable so you want to make sure the fit is perfect.”<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-8c6e46fd-2510-4b62-8f96-6877f18da490></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the point of a front closure bra?</span></p><p>As previously stated by Sena, front closure bras are designed primarily for people who have mobility and dexterity issues with their arms, hands, and shoulders, and who cannot clasp a back close bra. These bras have a hook and eye closure at the front, making them easy to fasten and undo when you're done wearing the bra.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Who should wear a front closure bra?</span></p><p>Anyone can wear a front closure bra, but Sena says but they are especially beneficial for those who struggle with back closures. “If you have issues getting your bra on in the morning because of a back closure, you can try this instead,” she says. “Or if you’ve recently had surgery and are sore and tender, this will make it quicker and easier to put on your bra.”&nbsp;</p><p>Breastfeeding women and women with wide-set breasts can also benefit from wearing a front-closure bra, Sena adds. “Nursing women could opt for a front closure bra since they can pop the clasp open with one hand and let baby feed," she explains. "It can also be great for women with splayed or wide-set breasts as it can essentially push the breasts together to create cleavage without a ton of padding or push-up.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What are the disadvantages of front open bras?</span></p><p>Sena explains that while front closure bras are easy to put on and take off, they do come with some disadvantages. “If the bra doesn't fit perfectly, you might experience spillage since there's no room to play with in the front of the bra,” she tells PEOPLE. “Additionally, you’ll want to keep in mind that you won't have the same adjustability as a back close [bra] which usually has three or four rows of hook and eye closure.”</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Courtney Leiva</a> is a contributing commerce writer for PEOPLE and has also written for publications including InStyle and Martha Stewart Living.
