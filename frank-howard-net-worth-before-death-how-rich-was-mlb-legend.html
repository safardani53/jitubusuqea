However, during that time, the players were not paid considerably.</p><p>Additionally, being a prominent player, he might have attracted some endorsement deals, helping him stack more wealth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-MLB-Legend-Frank-Howard-Died-At-The-Age-of-87.png><p>Frank Oliver Howard, aka the Capital Punisher, was an American <a href=#>baseball player,</a> coach, and manager in Major League Baseball.</p><p>He was born in Columbus, Ohio, to his parents, John and Erma Howard, as one of their six children.</p><p>After graduating from South High School, he attended Ohio State University, where he played baseball and basketball.</p><p>Although signed by the Philadelphia Warriors of the NBA, the 4x All-Star instead signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p><p>Later, the 1963 World Series champion played with Washington Senators (now Texas Rangers), Detroit Tigers of MLB, and Taiheiyo Club Lions of Japan’s Pacific League.</p><p>Following his professional playing career, he turned coach for several MLB teams, including Milwaukee Brewers, New York Mets, Seattle Mariners, New York Yankees, and Tampa Bay Devil Rays.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Washington Nationals Ring of Honor award winner died on October 30, 2023.</p><h2>How Rich Was MLB Legend? Net Worth Before Death</h2><p>Although no authentic source is available to verify the fact, Frank Howard is estimated to have a net worth of around $1 million at the time of his death.</p><p>The National League’s Rookie of the Year played with three teams in the MLB and one in the JPL.</p><p>However, there is no information about the salaries he got paid while playing for these teams.</p><p>Reportedly, <a href=# rel=noopener>over his 14-year career in the major league</a>, Howard accumulated earnings totaling $770,000, with his highest annual salary reaching $125,000 in 1970.</p><p>During the 1940s through the late 1960s, the average Major League salary was around $6,000. Given Frank’s prominence in the game, it’s reasonable to assume he earned well above this average.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Frank-Howard-During-His-Professional-Playing-Career-1.webp><p>Similarly, by the late 1970s, the average salary rose to $44,676. Howard, who played till 1974, got the opportunity to bag six-digit figures towards the end of his playing career.</p><p>Considering his talents and contributions to the sport, it’s worth noting that had Frank Howard played in today’s era, he would likely have been among the highest-paid players in Major League Baseball.</p><p>Furthermore, Howard also had a successful career as a coach and manager for various teams. His most extended coaching tenure was with the Mets, where he served in two separate stints, totaling four years.</p><p>As a coach and manager, he must have garnered several hundred dollars, contributing to his net worth.</p><h2>Frank Howard Is Survived By His Extended Family: Obituary</h2><p>Frank Howard passed away at the age of 87 on October 30, 2023, due to complications from a stroke.</p><p>He is remembered not only for his remarkable baseball career but also for his enduring family bonds.</p><p>The “Capital Punisher” had two marriages during his lifetime, first with <a href=#>Carol Johanski</a> and second with Donna Howard.</p><p>Frank and Carol tied the knot in 1959; however, they parted ways in the mid-1980s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Frank-Howard-Second-Wife-Donna-Scott.jpg><p>Later, Frank married Donna Howard in 1990. Unfortunately, their marriage was cut short as Donna passed away on March 13, 2016, following an 18-month battle with cancer.</p><p>Following the death of his second wife, Frank and his first wife rekindled their relationship.</p><p>Frank Howard, the late baseball legend, was a devoted family man. He and Carol raised a loving family together, including six children: Catherine, Tim, Daniel, Mary, Mitch, and Rebecca.</p><p>In the wake of Frank’s passing, he is survived by his beloved wife, his cherished children, and eight adoring grandchildren, leaving behind a legacy of both sporting excellence and enduring family ties.</p><p>Frank Howard’s memory lives on in the hearts of his family and all those who admired his “Capital Punisher” legacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCy0ZqlpGWYpMSivsNmpZ6sXay8s8DHZpmenp%2Bnsm6wxJqroWWYpMRuvsicn2avkah6rrjBZqOen5WjsXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffrank-howard-net-worth-before-death-how-rich-was-mlb-legend.html&text=How%20Rich%20Was%20MLB%20Legend%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrank-howard-net-worth-before-death-how-rich-was-mlb-legend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrank-howard-net-worth-before-death-how-rich-was-mlb-legend.html&title=How%20Rich%20Was%20MLB%20Legend%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffrank-howard-net-worth-before-death-how-rich-was-mlb-legend.html&title=How%20Rich%20Was%20MLB%20Legend%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffrank-howard-net-worth-before-death-how-rich-was-mlb-legend.html&title=How%20Rich%20Was%20MLB%20Legend%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrank-howard-net-worth-before-death-how-rich-was-mlb-legend.html&description=How%20Rich%20Was%20MLB%20Legend%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./marianna-komlos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Marianna Komlos">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./paracetamol-ibuprofen-drugs-after-use-by-dates.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="From paracetamol to ibuprofen  why you should never take drugs after their use-by-dates  The S">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
