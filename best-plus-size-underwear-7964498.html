And when it comes to shopping for plus size underwear, size is crucial. Full explains that many brands are still learning what a&nbsp;true plus size scale is, resulting in products that often run small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To avoid any sizing mishaps, she suggests looking for brands that showcase their underwear designs on different body types. “This will give you a better idea of how the item will fit, and having a plus size model is a good indicator that the brand used a plus size woman to fit test their designs,” Full says. "Not all brands do this, and it makes a huge difference when it comes to accurate sizing.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Support</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finding the right amount of support in underwear can be tricky, but it is possible. Just make sure you're getting the right amount of support by choosing undies with all the right features (elastic waistband and leg openings, comfortable fabric, etc.) before you hit buy. “It’s kind of like the tale of Goldilocks and the Three Bears,” Full explains. “You’ll want something that is not too stretchy and not too tight, but just right.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Quality&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Finding plus size lingerie you love isn’t easy, so a high-quality piece is often worth spending a little extra on,” Full tells PEOPLE. “These pieces are usually built to last, and the more you can use it, the more value you get.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Materials&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to underwear materials, the options are truly endless: silk, mesh, cotton, and more. But no matter what material you choose, the most important question to ask yourself is how it makes you feel, says Full.

Underwear made from synthetic materials tends to be less breathable than underwear made with cotton, silk, or bamboo fabricsw.
