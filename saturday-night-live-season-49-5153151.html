Since SNL season 48 was cut short, everyone’s been wondering about the status of Saturday Night Live season 49. Well, we now have an update! Season 49 will premiere this October.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>SNL is always at its strongest during an election year, and season 49 will undoubtedly embrace the 2024 presidential election cycle with epic and hilarious commentary. From the premiere date to the first hosts of the season, here’s a full rundown of all the latest updates about season 49.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Saturday-Night-Live-Season-49-snl-embed2.jpg><h2>Is SNL Season 49 Happening?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Saturday Night Live season 49 is a sure thing. The iconic series is a staple for the network, and the show is so close to celebrating 50 years on the air.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>SNL season 48 was cut short due to the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>writers’ strike in May 2023</a>. The final episodes were <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>supposed to be hosted</a> by <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kieran Culkin</strong></a>, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jennifer Coolidge</strong></a>, and SNL alum <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a>, but the remainder of the season had to be canceled.</p><h2>Saturday Night Live Season 49 Premiere Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Saturday Night Live season 49 will premiere on October 14. With the writers’ strike over, SNL was expected to return on either October 7 or 14, according to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>. The show usually premieres in September as part of NBC’s fall lineup, so SNL wasn’t too far off schedule!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Saturday-Night-Live-Season-49-snl-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>NBC already revealed its fall lineup for 2023, and Saturday Night Live wasn’t originally on it. However, the sketch comedy series could easily be added back in.

The SNL alum was originally supposed to make his hosting debut in May, but the show was forced to go dark due to the writers’ strike. This will mark Pete’s return to SNL after leaving the sketch comedy series in 2022. He joined the cast in 2014.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>The following week, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bad Bunny</strong></a> will be the host and musical guest.

I’d like to see that through and I have a feeling that’d be a good time to leave,” he said on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>CBS Mornings</a> in 2021.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-23>He added, “<span class=s1>I won’t want the show ever to be bad. I care too deeply about it. It’s been my life’s work. So I’m gonna do everything I can to see it carry on and carry on well.” When <strong>Gayle King</strong> asked if there can even be a Saturday Night Live without him, he responded, “Yeah, of course.” She also quizzed him about who could possibly take over for him. “</span><span class=s1>I have a sense of where we’re headed with that,” he said.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Saturday-Night-Live-Season-49-snl-embed7.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-24>However, Lorne told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Times</a> in 2022 that he had “no plans to retire.” He was still looking ahead to celebrating 50 years of SNL. “<span>The 50th will be a big event. We’ll bring everyone back from all 50 years and hosts and all of that. It will be a very emotional and very strong thing. There won’t be as many plus-ones, I can tell you that much,” he said.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-25>In July 2023, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The New York Post</a> reported that SNL vet <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tina Fey</strong></a> was “being courted” to take over as executive producer of SNL when Lorne decides to leave. Lorne and Tina have yet to respond to the report. A spokesperson for NBC told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ET Canada</a> that there was “no truth” to the claim about Tina taking over. Tina was a head writer and cast member of SNL from 1997 to 2006.</p><p id=content-paragraph-26><strong>Kenan Thompson</strong> is the show’s longest-running cast member. He joined the show in 2003 and has become the leader among the cast members. When asked about ending SNL at season 50, Kenan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>told <strong>Charlamagne tha God</strong></a>, <span>“There could be a lot of validity to that rumor because 50 is a good number to stop at.
