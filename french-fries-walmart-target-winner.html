Stater Bros. - 29 out of 30 points&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/stater-bros.jpg><p>The Stater Bros. brand was the clear winner as it got nearly a perfect score of 29 out of 30.</p><p>Not only did the fries taste great, but at $1.99, it’s worth the buy.</p><p>The fries had a great crunch and crisped up perfectly when I popped them into the air fryer.</p><p>They took just under 15 minutes to fully cook and get that crisp I look for.</p><p>If you don't have an air fryer fear not, you can pop them into the oven at 425 degrees for the same amount of time.</p><p>For those looking for a fast and cheap treat, these are the ones to grab.</p><h2>2. Whole Foods "365" - 25 out of 30 points</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/whole-foods.jpg><p>These were a close second but because it was priced at $3.99, the fries were docked.</p><p>Again, these had a great crunch to them and the size was fairly large.</p><p>You also get a pretty good amount in the bag so I guess the price can be justified.</p><p>These took a little longer to crisp up which I took into consideration when rating them.</p><p>This brand was also the only one that had the option of organic or regular and had a no sugar added notifier on the packaging which I thought was nice.</p><h2>3. Target "Market Pantry" - 23 out of 30 points</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/target.jpg><p>Next up we have the Target brand Market Pantry for $2.99.</p><p>If I could dock Target points for availability, I would.</p><p>I had to drive to multiple stores to find this brand as the french fry freezer section was low - which could be due to Labor Day weekend.</p><p>That aside, the fries tasted just okay.</p><p>They were quite large and very packed with potato which is to be expected.</p><p>There wasn't a ton of flavor and not a huge crunch factor which is what landed it in the third spot.</p><h2>4. Aldi "Season's Choice" - 22 out of 30 points</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/Aldi.jpg><p>The Aldi brand Season's Choice was priced at just $1.95 making this one the cheapest.</p><p>That being said, you get what you pay for.</p><p>The taste had very little flavor and no crunch at all.</p><p>Additionally, the inside of the fries had an interesting look and taste to them which lost some points from me.</p><p>On a positive note, these fries were massive and nearly every one I pulled from the bag looked the same.</p><p>This did lead to recooking them as they needed longer in the air fryer.</p><p>However, the size and cost were not enough to outweigh the flavor and cook time.</p><h2>5. Walmart "Great Value" - 19 out of 30 points&nbsp;</h2><p>The Walmart Great Value pack was priced at $1.98, so just a little more than Aldi but still cheaper than the rest.</p><p>Just by the packaging, I wasn’t impressed.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/09/Walmart.jpg><p>Once I opened and started feeling around, the actual fries were small, soft, and even a little slimy.</p><p>There was no crisp and absolutely zero flavor.</p><p>Typically, when I use the air fryer, I expect some crunch but there was none.</p><p>Plus, much like Aldi, since these had a ton of potato, they took longer to cook.</p><p>Based on all of those factors, this brand found itself in the bottom spot.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The Sun tried <a href=#>five honey oats</a> cereal including Aldi, Walmart and Cheerios – and a bargain product beat the name brand.</p><p>Plus, we also tasted <a href=#>four rotisserie chickens</a> including Costco and there was a clear winner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfa350g5NpaWieopq7pLSMn6minaNixKK4zJqprWWklr%2BosdNmrqKmnpq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ffrench-fries-walmart-target-winner.html&text=I%20tried%20five%20store-bought%20french%20fries%20including%20Walmart%20and%20Target%20-%20and%20the%20winner%20may%20surprise%20yo&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrench-fries-walmart-target-winner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrench-fries-walmart-target-winner.html&title=I%20tried%20five%20store-bought%20french%20fries%20including%20Walmart%20and%20Target%20-%20and%20the%20winner%20may%20surprise%20yo" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ffrench-fries-walmart-target-winner.html&title=I%20tried%20five%20store-bought%20french%20fries%20including%20Walmart%20and%20Target%20-%20and%20the%20winner%20may%20surprise%20yo" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ffrench-fries-walmart-target-winner.html&title=I%20tried%20five%20store-bought%20french%20fries%20including%20Walmart%20and%20Target%20-%20and%20the%20winner%20may%20surprise%20yo" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrench-fries-walmart-target-winner.html&description=I%20tried%20five%20store-bought%20french%20fries%20including%20Walmart%20and%20Target%20-%20and%20the%20winner%20may%20surprise%20yo" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kylie-jenner-super-tight-jawline-in-unedited-pic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kylie Jenner fans 'can't get over' her 'super-tight' jawline in 'super secret' unedited moment caugh">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./angel-carter-reacts-bobbie-jean-carter-death-8419973.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Angel Carter Pays Tribute to Sister Bobbie Jean After Her Sudden Death">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
