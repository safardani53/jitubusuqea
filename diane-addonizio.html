His brother is an attorney by profession.</p><p>The siblings were highly attracted to the law field and had always seen looking about it during their childhood.</p><p>Talking about her nationality, she holds American citizenship and belongs to the White ethnicity. She follows the Christian religion and her Zodiac sign is Capricorn.</p><p>Diane did her matriculation from Suburban High School in Red Bank. She then enrolled in Villanova University, a private Catholic research university near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p><p>In 1985, she did her graduation and earned a bachelor’s degree in Classical Studies. Further, she attended the <a href=#>University of Southern California’s</a> School of Law where she graduated with a law degree in 1987.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Diane_Addonizio_Career></span><strong>Diane Addonizio Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As a keen enthusiast of Law, Diane begins her career as a professional lawyer. However, she has not disclosed anything about her law career as she kept all the details far from the public eyes.</p><p>In fact, she hasn’t been practicing law for a long time. Due to a lack of information about her professional career, she isn’t recognized as a lawyer.</p><p>Diane came into the limelight after she engaged in a relationship with Howie Long. After that, she begins a new chapter with her partner and started supporting his business and profession.</p><p>Her husband, Howie Long is a former American football defensive end, actor, and sports analyst.</p><p>Now, Diane is totally focused on being a businesswoman and has completely left her lawyer profession by her end.

He called Diane for the first time to watch an NFL game on his TV. This is how the couple started their never-breaking relationship.</p><p>Diane has always played a supporting role in Howie’s life and in his career. This is also the reason why they have a strong relationship from their schooling days.</p><p>Diane Addonizio and her husband Howie Long have welcomed three children together.</p><p>The couple welcomed their first and eldest child, a son on 28 March 1985 and named Christopher Howard Long aka Chris Long.</p><p>Diane and Howie were again blessed with a son named Kyle Howard who was born on 5 December 1988.

She would be missing her early life more than everything.</p><p>She is highly known for being the wife of Howie Long. It would be obvious as star relatives, especially their wives became popular a day after getting into the media.</p><p>However, she has stabled herself on her own feet too, which means she has also her own identity at some level.</p><p>But sadly, she left her lawyer profession for some unknown reasons. Anyway, she is now happy in her life and enjoying it with her husband and with her three children.</p><p>Next Read: <a href=#>Who is Sophia Diamond?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HXrZmip5enrrG02GeaqKVfmbaiusRmmJ2cn6O2u7XOaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdiane-addonizio.html&text=Who%20is%20Diane%20Addonizio%3f%20Wife%20of%20Howie%20Long%20Bio%2c%20Wiki%20%26amp%3b%20Story&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdiane-addonizio.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdiane-addonizio.html&title=Who%20is%20Diane%20Addonizio%3f%20Wife%20of%20Howie%20Long%20Bio%2c%20Wiki%20%26amp%3b%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdiane-addonizio.html&title=Who%20is%20Diane%20Addonizio%3f%20Wife%20of%20Howie%20Long%20Bio%2c%20Wiki%20%26amp%3b%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdiane-addonizio.html&title=Who%20is%20Diane%20Addonizio%3f%20Wife%20of%20Howie%20Long%20Bio%2c%20Wiki%20%26amp%3b%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdiane-addonizio.html&description=Who%20is%20Diane%20Addonizio%3f%20Wife%20of%20Howie%20Long%20Bio%2c%20Wiki%20%26amp%3b%20Story" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jesse-borrego-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jesse Borrego Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./natalie-portman-ditches-ring-after-benjamin-millepied-affair-rumors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Natalie Portman Ditches Ring After Benjamin Millepied Affair Rumors">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
