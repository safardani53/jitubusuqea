Their first significant motion feature was Afterschool, and they went on to appear in the dramas We Need to Talk About Kevin and The Perks of Being a Wallflower.</p><p>The actor also portrays the Flash in DC Extended Universe (DCEU) films and TV series, first appearing as a cameo in the 2016 blockbusters Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad.&nbsp;As early as 2011, Ezra was credited as singing, playing drums, and playing percussion on Sons of an Illustrious Father music CDs. Since 2022, Miller has been accused of disorderly behavior, assault, and burglary, resulting in multiple high-profile arrests and punishments. They are also in charge of grooming young individuals.</p><h2>Ezra Miller Current Affair</h2><p>Current events involving Ezra Miller have piqued the interest of DC followers and admirers. The last several years have been trying in the DC Universe. As fresh scandals emerge, fans are still inconsolable. And Ezra Miller’s recent scandal has roiled the DC Universe.&nbsp;Viewers have been protesting the decision to replace Ezra Miller and co-CEO James Gunn as the Flash in the most recent DC picture. The fact that Michael Keaton will reprise his role as Batman suggests that Generation X is still willing to give Miller a chance. Concerning Ezra Miller’s present situation, the Flash has been plagued by controversy almost from its start.</p><p>Some fans called for a boycott of the new film because of the conduct of the actor who played the main character, Miller. According to fans, the fact that Ezra Miller continues to serve as The Flash despite the charges proves that the cancellation culture persists only when it does not severely impact the firms’ financial lines.</p><p>Miller apologized for his previous behavior in a statement to Variety on August 15, 2022, claiming that he had “gone through a time of intense crisis.” In addition, the artist indicated that he had begun counseling for “complex mental health issues.” Others were reported in a September 2022 Vanity Fair article as claiming Ezra was Jesus, the Devil, and the Next Messiah.</p><h2>Controversy And Scandal Involving Ezra Miller</h2><p>Ezra Miller was expected to portray The Flash, a flower child eccentric from Vermont, a homosexual blockbuster movie star, and an advocate for victims of gender-based violence. Instead, in the 2020s, a new Ezra Miller emerged, one accused of grooming an 18-year-old Sioux activist and caught on tape violently attacking a fan in an Icelandic bar.&nbsp;Miller went from independent celebrity to Harry Potter income to getting charged with burglary in a matter of months.</p><p>On June 28, 2011, while filming The Perks of Being a Wallflower in Pittsburgh, the actor was a passenger in a vehicle that was stopped due to a broken brake light. According to authorities, Miller was in possession of 20 grams of marijuana. On April 6, 2020, a since-deleted tweet included a video purportedly showing Miller strangling and knocking down a woman. Variety confirmed that the video was taken at Priki Kaffih’s, a bar in Reykjavik, Iceland, which Miller often visits.&nbsp;Miller was arrested in Hawaii on March 28, 2022, after participating in what police characterized as a heated dispute with patrons at a karaoke bar. He was charged with disorderly conduct and harassment.&nbsp;Furthermore, on June 16, 2022, a Massachusetts woman and her 12-year-old son obtained a temporary harassment prevention order against Miller after alleging that the actor had made threats against their family and improperly acted toward the child.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGics6qRYrqquMueqWabn6PBs7vVnqmssV2staLAjJ2gnWWYmnqlu4ysmpqmlJa5bq3NnWScraKnsq%2FAjJqdn5mZp3w%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fezra-miller-controversy-what-did-he-do-scandal-and-current-affair.html&text=Ezra%20Miller%20Controversy%3a%20What%20Did%20He%20Do%3f%20Scandal%20And%20Current%20Affair&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fezra-miller-controversy-what-did-he-do-scandal-and-current-affair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fezra-miller-controversy-what-did-he-do-scandal-and-current-affair.html&title=Ezra%20Miller%20Controversy%3a%20What%20Did%20He%20Do%3f%20Scandal%20And%20Current%20Affair" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fezra-miller-controversy-what-did-he-do-scandal-and-current-affair.html&title=Ezra%20Miller%20Controversy%3a%20What%20Did%20He%20Do%3f%20Scandal%20And%20Current%20Affair" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fezra-miller-controversy-what-did-he-do-scandal-and-current-affair.html&title=Ezra%20Miller%20Controversy%3a%20What%20Did%20He%20Do%3f%20Scandal%20And%20Current%20Affair" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fezra-miller-controversy-what-did-he-do-scandal-and-current-affair.html&description=Ezra%20Miller%20Controversy%3a%20What%20Did%20He%20Do%3f%20Scandal%20And%20Current%20Affair" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./meghan-markle-im-the-most-hated-person-on-the-planet.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="I'm the Most Hated Person on the Planet!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./barbara-cochran-19510104-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Barbara Cochran (Skier) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
