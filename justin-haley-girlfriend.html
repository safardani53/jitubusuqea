revealed, but based on the fact that her older brother, was born on October 25, 1995, it is fair to assume that she was born in the late 1990s or the early 2000s.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Haley-Hunter.jpg><p>However, without official confirmation, her birth year remains uncertain.</p><p>Not much about her early life is known, but we do know that her mother is Jody Mottinger, and she grew up with her only sibling, an older brother, Hunter Mottinger.</p><p>Jodi is the co-head coach at Willmar.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Talking about her education, Haley went to Willmar Senior High School and ran track under her mother’s guidance.</p><p>While there, she qualified for MSHSL State Track and Field competition in girls’ 4X 200 and 100 meters hurdle.</p><p>She graduated high school with honors in 2016 and enrolled at South Dakota State University.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Haley-Graduates.jpg><p>Just like in high school, she ran track and pole vaulted in college and, as a sophomore, won the 100-meter hurdle.</p><p>This was the first time Mottinger had won the event, and she set a new personal best with a time of 14.73 seconds.</p><p>For this performance, Mottinger became The Collegian Athlete of the Week.</p><p>She graduated college in 2021.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>According to her LinkedIn profile, Haley has worked in a bunch of different companies over the course of her career.</p><p>She started off with an internship and then joined Eagle Creek Golf Club for beverage sales full-time in May 2017.</p><p>She worked there for three years and four months.</p><p>After that, she worked as a server at The Breakers Palm Beach in West Palm Beach, Florida.</p><p>In August of the same year, Haley joined Oxford Global Resources in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida as an account manager.</p><p>And finally, she has been engaged with Jupiter Country Club as F&B and golf operation manager since November 2021.</p><h2>Soon To Be Haley Haley</h2><p>Justin Haley used the opportunity between the Bristol Dirt Race and a free weekend to get engaged to his girlfriend Haley Mottinger.</p><p>The No. 31 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 driver popped the question to his girlfriend on 11 April 2023 at Chestoa View Overlook in Linville, North Carolina.</p><p>The couple has not been together long, but when you live your life at high speeds, things move quickly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Question-Haley-Justin.jpg><p>The interesting part of their union will probably be Haley’s name.</p><p>Because apparently, she will become Haley Haley if she decides to take Justin’s last name.</p><p>The SDSU alumnus was part of the winning shuttle hurdle relay at the Drake Relays.</p><p>They seem to be a perfect match for each other because Justin goes fast in a car, and Mottinger on her feet.</p><h3>The Question</h3><p>Justin had quite a venue to pop the question. With lush green background, he got on one knee and asked for Haley’s approval with a beautiful diamond ring.</p><p>The atmosphere was magical, and the vibe was great, Haley could not resist and said yes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Justin-Haley-Ring.jpg><p>The couple shared their magical moment on their social media handle. Justin added four pictures of the special moment on his Instagram with a beautiful caption that read, “It’s incredible the impact you’ve made on my life in such a short amount of time. I’m so blessed to spend forever by your side. 🤍”.</p><h2>A Brief On Justin Haley</h2><p>Justin Haley was born to Jet Linx Indianapolis Pilot John Haley on April 28, 1999, in Winamac, Indiana.</p><p>He is the nephew of the owner of Braun Motorsports, Todd Braun.</p><p>Haley is one of the four children of his parents, with an older brother and two younger sisters.</p><p>He began his racing career early at the age of nine, in Quarter Midgets at&nbsp;Kokomo&nbsp;Quarter Midget&nbsp;Club during the late summer months of 2008.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Justin-Haley-1.jpg><p>Fast forward a decade, and he came in 12th in his NASCAR Xfinity Series debut at Iowa Speedway in June 2018.</p><p>The following year, he joined Spire Motorsports No. 77 for the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series debut at Talladega Superspeedway.</p><p>Driver Haley qualified in the 34th position for the 2019 Coke Zero Sugar 400 at Daytona.</p><p>During the race, a collision between <a href=#>Austin Dillon</a> and Clint Bowyer caused “The Big One” with around 30 laps to go.</p><p>Haley, positioned in 27th, narrowly avoided the pile-up and impressively maneuvered his way through the chaos to finish in 3rd place.</p><p>His 2023 season started rough, with a disappointing 32nd finish at the 2023 Daytona 500.</p><p>And like that was not enough, his team was hit with an L2 penalty on March 15 for unapproved hood louvers during a pre-race inspection at Phoenix.</p><h2>Unknown Facts About Justin Haley</h2><ul><li>Justin Haley is vegan.</li><li>He became the 32nd driver to win a race in all three NASCAR national touring series after scoring his first Xfinity victory in 2020.</li><li>Haley made his Camping World Truck Series debut at Bristol with&nbsp;Braun Motorsports in 2015, driving the No. 32&nbsp;Chevrolet Silverado.
