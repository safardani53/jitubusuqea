When his parents learned that their son would make his AFL debut against the Brisbane Lions in 2018, they were ecstatic. The St Kilda player is presently involved in a trade call with North Melbourne. Similarly, Essendon has shown interest in the AFL player.</p><h2>Fiona and Rob Clark, Hunter Clark’s Parents: Learn More About His Family</h2><p><strong>Hunter Clark</strong> was born in Melbourne, Australia, on March 26, 1999, to loving parents Fiona Clark and Rob Clark. The Clarks live on Mount Martha, surrounded by picturesque beaches and cliffs. Hunter Clark gets along well with his parents. On Instagram and Facebook, the Saints star often uploads photos of his mother and father.&nbsp;Hunter Clark’s parents live a wealthy and calm life on the Mornington Peninsula, which is about an hour’s drive from Melbourne.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hunter-Clark-1.jpg alt="Hunter Clark" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Fiona, the football player’s mother, is self-employed and runs a modest company. From her home on the Mornington Peninsula, she presently manages an internet bakery called Baked 11. They have rustic cakes, cupcakes, and cookies for sale.&nbsp;Fiona is active on social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook. She updates her account with photos of her children, pets, and husband. The footballer’s mum also has a separate Instagram business account to market her bakery.</p><p>Hunter’s father, Rob, is a cheerful guy in his forties. He is bald and wears glasses with prescriptions. Rob, unlike his wife, is not on any social networking site. As a result, information on his work, early life, and age is unclear.&nbsp;The 23-year-old playfully referred to his father as his “old mate” and “boss” in an Instagram post. The father-son connection is amusing.&nbsp;Hunter Clark is the eldest of two brothers and sisters. Angus Clark, his younger brother, plays with the Dandenong Southern Stingrays in the NAB League for under-19 Australian rules football. He also has a sister called Molly Clark, who is 21 years old.&nbsp;The AFL athlete liked spending time with his mom and siblings during the lockdown.</p><h2>Hunter Clark Net Worth And Salary: How Much Does The Saints Player Make?</h2><p>Clark was drafted as a midfielder by St Kilda in the 2017 AFL draft after graduating from Padua College. He was also the seventh overall selection in that year’s draft. Since 2017, the Mount Martha native has appeared in 68 games for St Kilda. The Saints rookie made his debut in 2018 and was nominated for the AFL Rising Star award.&nbsp;In 2020, the No. 7 draft selection had a breakthrough season and was named to the AFL Players’ Association 22Under22 team. Clark signed a two-year contract extension with St Kilda through 2023 the same year.</p><p>North Melbourne, on the other hand, is very interested in the former top-10 draft selection and feels they can get him for next season for a reasonable price.&nbsp;The 23-year-old player has had a difficult time in the AFL, suffering various injuries that have slowed his growth and career.&nbsp;Clark is still young, thus his net worth is estimated to be in the $500k to $1 million range. In 2018, the average yearly wage for a St Kilda player was $256,010, while North Melbourne players earned $246,990. However, the figures have risen after a 38% salary boost in 2021.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Hunter-Clark-2.jpg alt="Hunter Clark" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Clark got a minimum of $88,000 in his first year with St Kilda as a first-round selection choice.&nbsp;Following the effect of COVID-19 and a wage limit, St Kilda players, including Hunter, decided to accept a 7% pay decrease in 2021.</p><h2>Hunter Clark’s Girlfriend: Is He In A Relationship?</h2><p>The professional AFL player seems to be completely focused on his football career and does not appear to have much time for relationships. On his social media, he makes no mention of a close buddy or a lover.&nbsp;Assuming the 23-year-old athlete is now single is thus safe. During the off-season, he does have a lot of fun with high school pals. The Australian footballer often gathers with his teammates for a drink or a relaxed swim.&nbsp;After returning from abroad next week, the Saints star is expected todeciden on his future career. North Melbourne, in particular, will be vying for the No. 7 overall selection.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsButNSnq56qXZi5or7KZp2op6SXrq24jKmjmrGVp3qxrdGepa2rXaOytXnWqKmtoF2Wu6V5xqKppZ6inrKvsI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-hunter-clark-football-player-parents-net-worth-and-girlfriend.html&text=Who%20Is%20Hunter%20Clark%3f%20Football%20Player%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Girlfriend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-hunter-clark-football-player-parents-net-worth-and-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-hunter-clark-football-player-parents-net-worth-and-girlfriend.html&title=Who%20Is%20Hunter%20Clark%3f%20Football%20Player%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-hunter-clark-football-player-parents-net-worth-and-girlfriend.html&title=Who%20Is%20Hunter%20Clark%3f%20Football%20Player%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-hunter-clark-football-player-parents-net-worth-and-girlfriend.html&title=Who%20Is%20Hunter%20Clark%3f%20Football%20Player%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-hunter-clark-football-player-parents-net-worth-and-girlfriend.html&description=Who%20Is%20Hunter%20Clark%3f%20Football%20Player%20Parents%2c%20Net%20Worth%20And%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-miles-plumlee-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Miles Plumlee Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-dee-barnes-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Dee Barnes Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
