She used an app to find his whereabouts and then proceeded to Airbnb.</p><p>When she arrived at the residence, she saw Earl and his brother, Seth Thomas, on the bed with another lady.</p><p>She grabbed a 9mm Berreta handgun and placed it at Earl’s head.</p><p>Heisser pulled the magazine out of the pistol, assuming it couldn’t shoot. She intended to scare him. Nina was, however, oblivious to the fact that the pistol had a bullet in the chamber.</p><p>Earl was strong enough to pull Heisser’s gun from her hand. The cops detained her and two female companions she had accompanied to the Airbnb.&nbsp;</p><h2>Nina Heisser | Arrest</h2><p>After a fight with her husband, Earl Thomas’s <a href=# rel=noopener>wife</a>, Nina Thomas, was arrested on April 13th, 2020.</p><p>She found out her husband Earl was cheating on her. As a response, she pointed a loaded gun at Thomas’s head, standing less than a foot away.</p><p>After receiving a report regarding an incident, the Austin Police Department responded to a residence in the Austin, Texas, area around 3:41 am. She was then later placed under police surveillance.</p><p>According to the Police’s Statement,</p><p>“We observed that a black female wearing an orange sweater with a knife in her hand, later identified as Nina Thomas, was chasing a shirtless black male, later identified as Earl Thomas, with a pistol in his hand around a vehicle.”</p><h2>Nina Heisser | Prison</h2><p>According to ESPN’s Jamison Hensley, she was charged with first-degree felony burglary of a house to conduct attempted murder with a dangerous weapon.</p><p>Nina Thomas’ lawyer told ESPN that she was “wrongfully arrested.”</p><p>According to the Austin police, Nina Thomas was released on a $25,000 bail in April.</p><p>Two other ladies involved in the altercation with Nina were also released. Camisha Garlow was charged with a $15,000 bond, while Kayla Baham-Heisser was accused of a $100,00 bond.</p><h3>Earl Thomas Statement</h3><p>Nina was eventually arrested, but Earl revealed shortly after the incident that the two attempted to work matters out. Thomas posted on his Instagram account, saying:</p><p>“So my agent just hit me and said that I’m gonna be on TMZ tomorrow from an altercation that happened with me and Nina.”</p><p>“So, I just want to get ahead of it, and I mean, it’s really not anybody’s business… Just pray for us as we go through this stuff.

He came into the limelight again for punching his teammate Chuck Clark during the match. It heated because Thomas missed a coverage that allowed Mark Andrews to score a long touchdown.</p><p>He was advised not to come for the training and was released from the team for conduct detrimental to the section on August 22.</p><p>Harbaugh consulted the team’s Leadership Council of veteran players, and only one of them wanted him to return to the team. No other team signed him during that season.</p><p>According to an article by The Athletic, Thomas had developed a reputation of “uncoachable.” As to his former teammates from the Seahawks and coaches, he never behaved correctly, as he frequently refused to practice.</p><p>When he signed with the Baltimore, he never really became a part of the Ravens’ locker-room culture. He often paid fines for skipping meetings or showing up late and left the team whenever he wanted, which happened twice.</p><p>At the time of the 2020 pre-season, Earl became increasingly surly and withdrawn, frequently for skipping meetings and walk-throughs.</p><p>The altercation between Clark and Thomas would not have blown the coverage had he taken part in walk-throughs.</p><p>The Houston Texans considered signing him, but this idea was withdrawn after consultation with the team member.</p><p>As of 2022, Thomas has not played any matches in <a href=# rel=noopener>NFL</a>. However, according to a source, he was rumored to return to the Baltimore Ravens team.</p><p>But, no further information is available regarding this; also, Pro Football Talk reminds us that grievance is still pending to this day, years later, worth $10 million with the Ravens.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p>Nina’s social media presence is impressive as she puts a lot of effort into her social appearance. She has around 33.9k Instagram followers as of 2022.</p><p>Nina spends most of her time posting cheerful pictures of herself with her parents, husbands, and children.</p><p>However, owing to their horrible April incidents, Nina and her husband received a lot of attention on social media and were front-page news in every publication a year ago.</p><h2>Popularity Graph</h2><p>Nina Heisser is the former wife of Earl Thomas, a former NFL player.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Nina.jpg><p>Her search on the internet hiked as she came into highlight because of her relationship with Earl Thomas.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Is Nina Heisser married?</h3><p>Heisser was married to Earl Thomas, but as of 2022, she is a single mother.
