Ken asked.</p><p>Andrew, who had only won 5 regular season games, quietly revealed: "I gotta do it all of it," and bet his entire $7K.</p><p>Ken gasped and said: "Wow, betting everything."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>It read: "After helping to establish this as an independent country, Eduard Shevardnadze became its president in 1995."</p><p>Andrew got it correct with "Georgia" and went from $7K to $14K.</p><p>But he 'Daily Doubled' up.</p><h2>'I DID NOT THINK YOU'D SAY THAT'</h2><p>Andrew then landed on the other remaining Daily Double.</p><p>With $16.8K, he again bet: "All of it," without a second of pause, and the crowd hushed.</p><p>Host Ken said: "I did not think you were gonna say that."</p><p>It read: "'Haworth Churchyard' was Matthew Arnold's tribute to these literary sisters, written soon after the last one passed."</p><p>Andrew was again correct with "The Bronte Sisters" and after two all-in Daily Double bets, had $33.6K.</p><p>The book was closed after that, and fans were shocked Mattea didn't win, but wowed that Andrew bet it all not once, but twice.</p><p>He had a runaway going into Final Jeopardy at $39K with $17K for Eric and $7,200 for Mattea in third, who smiled proudly.</p><p>No one even had a guess on Final Jeopardy - all three hilariously just wrote a question mark, and Andrew unquestionably emerged as the last finalist in the Tournament of Champions.</p><h2>'MY JAW WAS ON THE FLOOR'</h2><p>One Reddit user wrote: "Andrew's first all-in had me excited, but the second one... Y'all, my jaw was on the floor."</p><p>Another agreed: "Need to send Andrew the bill for my blood pressure doctor visit after THAT."</p><p>A third wrote: "Andrew CRUSHED this game today. He really does have what it takes to defeat Mattea Roach (23-day super-champion)."</p><p>A fourth lamented: "Mattea :(" and a fifth had to agree: "Yeah, two days in a row where I’m disappointed on a sentimental level."</p><p>But one more admitted: "That might’ve been the greatest thing I’ve ever seen in this show."</p><p>"I really thought it was a mistake - I screamed with joy when he pulled it off."</p><p>A final fan wrote as they watched Andrew go for broke twice: "I pulled my shirt up over my head and covered my ears - wow."</p><h2>UNEXPECTED FINAL THREE</h2><p>This year's&nbsp;<a href=#>Tournament of Champions</a>&nbsp;started airing on October 31.</p><p><a href=#>40-time winner Amy</a>, Andrew, and fan-favorite&nbsp;<a href=#>Sam Buttrey who beat Matt Amodio in a similar upset</a> have emerged as the three finalists.</p><p>This year's tournament has featured more super-champions (or contestants who have won more than 10 games) than any year prior - 4 regular season wins are needed to be considered.</p><p>Tonight was Mattea's first match since <a href=#>Mattea, Amy and Matt Amodio</a> were seeded and got byes given their prior win counts.</p><p>But 38-time champ Matt lost to professor Sam, who proved to be a powerhouse last night, and tonight was sadly Mattea's turn - so only one super-champ is in the finals.</p><p>Mattea, Matt (and earlier, 16-time winner <a href=#>Ryan Long) were knocked out</a> in shock moments - so past stats have proven no measure of success.</p><p>Starting Monday, the final three will play until one of them wins three matches - which could take three days or stretch on for seven showdowns.</p><p>Regular episodes and&nbsp;<a href=#>reigning ace Cris Pannullo</a>&nbsp;will return mid-November when it all concludes.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Ken&nbsp;will step aside from the iconic game show in January so that co-host&nbsp;<a href=#>Mayim Bialik</a>&nbsp;- now handling&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Jeopardy!</a>&nbsp;- can take the reins.</p><p>Over the summer, he and actress&nbsp;Mayim, 46,&nbsp;were officially announced as the permanent replacements for the&nbsp;<a href=#>late, great Alex Trebek</a>&nbsp;- the&nbsp;<a href=#>two-year anniversary</a>&nbsp;of his passing was this week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/taken-without-permission-one-two-774713494.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/taken-without-permission-one-two-774713520.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/Screen-Shot-2022-11-11-at-6.54.40-PM.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huZmqFcX6SaKGep6CWv6XFjKaYrayVlnqzu8Ccn2akn6iytHnAp5urnadisaK1y7Jknaell7mmedOommaemaOurb%2BO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-mattea-roach-loses-andrew-daily-double-toc-finals.html&text=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20stunned%20as%20frontrunner%20Mattea%20Roach%20loses%20to%20underdog%20with%20%27heart-stopping%27%20Tournamen&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-mattea-roach-loses-andrew-daily-double-toc-finals.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-mattea-roach-loses-andrew-daily-double-toc-finals.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20stunned%20as%20frontrunner%20Mattea%20Roach%20loses%20to%20underdog%20with%20%27heart-stopping%27%20Tournamen" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeopardy-mattea-roach-loses-andrew-daily-double-toc-finals.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20stunned%20as%20frontrunner%20Mattea%20Roach%20loses%20to%20underdog%20with%20%27heart-stopping%27%20Tournamen" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-mattea-roach-loses-andrew-daily-double-toc-finals.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20stunned%20as%20frontrunner%20Mattea%20Roach%20loses%20to%20underdog%20with%20%27heart-stopping%27%20Tournamen" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-mattea-roach-loses-andrew-daily-double-toc-finals.html&description=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20stunned%20as%20frontrunner%20Mattea%20Roach%20loses%20to%20underdog%20with%20%27heart-stopping%27%20Tournamen" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./pamela-anderson-young-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="See Photos of the Star Through the Years  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jeffree-star-beauty-community-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jeffree Star Says The James and Tati Stuff 'Ruined the Beauty Community">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
