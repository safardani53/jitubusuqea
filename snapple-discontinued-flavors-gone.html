LIME GREEN TEA</h2><p>Green Tea Snapples have claimed the hearts of Americans everywhere, but once upon a time, the brand actually tried its hand at a more citrusy version of the beverage.</p><p>The drink first made an appearance in the 2000s and was a stark contrast to the original Green Tea flavor.</p><p>There was a much higher proportion of lime than tea, and past reviewers said it was hard to note any green tea flavor at all.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>This could have led to the product’s discontinuation since the taste didn’t actually match what the beverage advertised.</p><h2>2. SAMOAN SPLASH</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/fans-xxx-taken-without-permission-809469455.jpg><p>Some Snapple fans adored the Samoan Splash flavor as it brought back memories of island getaways and vacations yet to come.</p><p>The exact flavor profile gave hints of orange, banana, strawberry, and cupuaçu.</p><p>However, as one of Snapple’s original Island Cocktail line of flavors, it did not appear to draw enough fans for it to stay around long.</p><p>While strawberry and banana make a compelling flavor duo, not many Americans even knew what the Brazilian cupuaçu fruit even was.</p><p>This lack of awareness might have prevented some shoppers from getting on board with the flavor.</p><p>Those who did try the Samoan Splash compared it to a basic strawberry and banana smoothie, so Snapple fans looking for a more tropical taste might have been disappointed too.</p><h2>3. SNAPPLE SODAS</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/fans-xxx-taken-without-permission-809469458.jpg><p>Back in the day, you could actually drink a beverage that was designed to perfectly blend Snapples and sodas together.</p><p>The brand decided to expand beyond its iced tea and juice flavors to launch a line of caffeine-free sodas in the 1980s.</p><p>Some of the most famed flavors included Tru Root Beer, Peach Melba, French Cherry, Cream D’Vanilla, Passion Fruit, Chocolate, and Cherry-Lime Rickey.</p><p>While the new creations made quite a splash in the drink scene when they first came out, they were all but gone by the mid-1990s.</p><p>Many fans are hoping the line could make a comeback, but Snapple has been quiet on the matter.</p><p>“On a fine spring day like this one, seems a shame to not be able to pop open a Snapple Cherry-Lime Rickey and quench that thirst with a tart and sweet Rickey wash,” a loyal fan wrote of the discarded Snapple sodas in <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Dallas Observer.</a></p><h2>4. GUAVA MANIA</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/fans-xxx-taken-without-permission-809469490.jpg><p>Another tropical Snapple flavor that haunts loyal fans is Guava Mania.</p><p>The blend was initially popular in the 1990s when shoppers enjoyed the refreshing and sweet pink juice.</p><p>It gave a flavor profile of guava, kiwi, and strawberry, but unfortunately, not all things are meant to last.</p><p>Snapple has mostly abandoned guava as a flavor component in its drinks now.</p><p>However, some shoppers recall the drink being one of the more unique options available and they want it back.</p><p>"Hey, @Snapple whose idea it was to get rid of Guava Mania Cocktail, FIRE THEM IMMEDIATELY," a Twitter user wrote to the company.</p><h2>5. SUMMER PEACH</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/04/fans-xxx-taken-without-permission-809469473.jpg><p>Nothing hit perfectly on a warm, beautiful day like Snapple’s Summer Peach drink.</p><p>Fans loved it for its citrusy orange flavor combined with the sweet deliciousness of peaches.&nbsp;</p><p>The color of the beverage alone could beckon you away into memories of a gorgeous beach sunset.</p><p>While many fans have asked Snapple if it’s possible to bring the beloved drink back, it does not seem likely at this point.</p><p>"Unfortunately, Summer Peach has been discontinued. However, we'll be sure to pass along the demand to our team," Snapple wrote on Twitter to one customer earnestly asking for the beverage to make a comeback.</p><p>Some fans have recommended the Summer Peach lemonade from Calypso as a worthy substitute, however.</p><p>"Idk if ppl remember the summer peach Snapple, but it was my favorite thing ever as a kid,” one fan tweeted. “It only came out during the summer months and I was starting to think I imagined it lmao.</p><p>"I had this Calypso today and it tastes the EXACT same.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><a href=#>Kroger</a> also confirmed a <a href=#>fan-favorite snack</a> has been discontinued, but shoppers are holding out hope it could make a return.</p><p>Some brands do listen to customers when they ask for items to come back, including <a href=#>Taco Bell</a>, which just brought back the iconic <a href=#>Nacho Fries.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfbIV2gpNpcGirnpa9sbjEZpuiq5Oku7W1za6cnWWWoa63u9GsZKCnnpp8</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsnapple-discontinued-flavors-gone.html&text=Five%20bottled%20beverages%20you%27ll%20never%20drink%20again%20-%20and%20fans%20are%20upset&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsnapple-discontinued-flavors-gone.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsnapple-discontinued-flavors-gone.html&title=Five%20bottled%20beverages%20you%27ll%20never%20drink%20again%20-%20and%20fans%20are%20upset" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsnapple-discontinued-flavors-gone.html&title=Five%20bottled%20beverages%20you%27ll%20never%20drink%20again%20-%20and%20fans%20are%20upset" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsnapple-discontinued-flavors-gone.html&title=Five%20bottled%20beverages%20you%27ll%20never%20drink%20again%20-%20and%20fans%20are%20upset" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsnapple-discontinued-flavors-gone.html&description=Five%20bottled%20beverages%20you%27ll%20never%20drink%20again%20-%20and%20fans%20are%20upset" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./rick-and-morty-memes-best-pics-funny-cynical-humorous-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Top 50 Best 'Rick and Morty' Memes Picked By A Rick And Morty Fan">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./daniel-boaventura-wife-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Daniel Boaventura Is a Doting Father to Two Daughters with Ex Wife">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
