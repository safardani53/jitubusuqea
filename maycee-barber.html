Early Life and Family</span></h2><p><span><strong>Maycee Barber</strong> was born on May 18, 1998, in Greeley, Colorado, United States. She was born to proud parents <strong>Bucky Barber</strong> and <strong>Maryanne Barber</strong>.</span></p><p><span>Maycee is one of six children of her parents. She is the second oldest. </span><span>Bucky and Maryanne Barber indulged almost all their children in martial arts at an early age.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Maycee-Barbers-family.jpg><p><span>Maycee got into Karate when she was three. </span><span>In fact, she was eligible enough to teach martial arts to adults by the age of 13 at their family’s martial arts academy in Fort Collins, Colorado.</span></p><p><span>Bucky and Maryanne wanted their children to be strong and firm, but they never thought of pushing them to pursue it as a profession.</span></p><p><span>Maycee broke the news about how much she wished to be a UFC fighter to her parents when she was just 13 or 14.</span></p><p><span>They could not respond with grace as they never wanted to see their little daughter receiving punches and kicks.</span></p><p><span>They introduced MMA to their children for self-defense. Nonetheless, they supported her wholeheartedly after discovering that their daughter’s happiness lies in those punches and kicks.</span></p><p>You might be interested in reading:&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Montana De La Rosa: MMA, Career, Family & Net Worth.</a></strong></p><h3><span>Maycee’s Family | They made it a family affair.</span></h3><p><span>The family concluded that Maycee had to receive the best of the training because the better she gets, the fewer punches she will receive.</span></p><p>Maycee’s parents took her all over the United States, searching for opportunities and looking for new techniques.&nbsp;</p><p><span>They were so driven by the idea of making Maycee the best that they drove from Fort Collins to Albuquerque, New Mexico, every other week.</span></p><p><span>Maycee trained with <strong>Greg Jackson</strong> and <strong>Brandon Gibson</strong> in New Mexico. </span><span>They tried their best to tie Maycee’s fate with <a href=#><strong>Matt Hume</strong></a>, who is considered one of the best MMA coaches.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Maycee-and-her-elder-sister-Emma.jpg><p><span>Maycee got associated with Team Alpha Male. Her parents made her meet and learn from <strong>Ryan Schultz</strong> and <strong>Matt Pena</strong>, <strong>Marc Montoya,</strong> and <strong>Izzy Martinez</strong>, and not.</span></p><p><span>The ‘meeting and learning from everyone in the company’ theory bothered some of the coaches.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>However, Bucky Barber didn’t care what an outsider would say. He held to his idea that they have to give their best for their daughter’s wellbeing.</span></p><p><span>He once said that he would happily close his business and move halfway across the country if that would help his daughter. </span><span>It is said that no one could raise a girl child better than a feminist father.</span></p><p><span>Bucky Barber is indeed a father and a feminist at the same time. </span><span>If it were not for Bucky and Maryanne, Maycee would not have been the champion today.</span></p><h3><span>Maycee and The Family | The Team that landed her in places.</span></h3><p><span>Barber has trained with a lot of coaches. Her father refers to her as Bruce Lee kind of martial artist that requires a little bit from everywhere.</span></p><p><span>He believes that his girl has practiced enough, and messing with the same coach again and again would block her cognitive ability.</span></p><p><span>She did two or three reps at a high black belt level. Hence, meeting new people and grabbing their ideas would help her best.</span></p><p><span>Maycee earned a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu just by watching Gracie University’s online video series with her older sister, <strong>Emma Barber</strong>.</span></p><p><span>In fact, it was more like learning second-hand from Emma after she adapts from the video.</span></p><p>You might also be interested in reading:&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vicente Luque’s Bio: MMA Career, Family, Net worth, & Wiki</a>.</strong></p><h3><span>Then The Transition Happened</span></h3><p><span>Bucky and Maryanne had to shut down their martial arts academy and moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. They did so to support Maycee and her younger brother, Wyatt.</span></p><p><span>The Barber siblings then got their hands into elite coaching. Maycee trained with <strong>Marc Montoya</strong> at Factory X.</span></p><p><span>Moreover, the family made a business transition from an MMA academy to a coffee shop. They found one on sale online and took it.</span></p><p><span>Maycee had to be an MMA champion. It was not just for her but the entire Barber family.</span></p><p><span>Her brother, <strong>Wyatt Barber</strong>, is currently signed to Bellator MMA.

Maycee got into 4-0 with three stoppages. </span><span>UFC then provided her the opportunity to compete in Dana White’s Contender Series.</span></p><h3><span>Dana White’s Tuesday Night Contender Series</span></h3><p><span>Dana White’s Tuesday Night Contender Series, known as <a href=#>Dana White</a>‘s Contender Series now, is an American MMA promotion.</span></p><p><span>In the series, <a href=#>Dana White</a>, the current UFC president, scouts talented mixed martial artists who could be seen in the UFC.</span></p><p><span>Maycee fought against Jamie Colleen on July 17, 2018, on Dana White’s Contender Series.
