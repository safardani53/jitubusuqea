It’s all violence, weapons and drugs. It will be so depressing."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><p>But he has settled in well since arriving at Britain's biggest top security jail where he is in a single cell on A wing which holds 108 vulnerable inmates who enjoy enhanced status.</p><p>A source said: "Other inmates have been fine with him and the staff have all been very professional.</p><p>"He doesn't have any complaints so far - unlike all the moaning he did at Broadmoor. He hated the regime there but seems happy in Frankland."</p><p>Sutcliffe underwent a major medical assessment every four or five years while at Broadmoor.</p><p>In September of 2014 as he was about to have another one, he told a friend that the doctor he was seeing was the same one he saw in 2005 who said his mental illness was cured and he was fit to return to prison.</p><p>Sutcliffe said: "I last saw him nine years ago and he said I was all right, I wasn't ill.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/nintchdbpict000191542914.jpg><p>"He wanted to send me back to prison. That wouldn't be a good idea.</p><p>“I'd lose all my contacts, I wouldn't have my correspondence, I wouldn't be able to ring people every night.</p><p>"It would be a real downer, it wouldn't be much good for my health either. You're just banged up and they forget about you."</p><p>Despite that diagnosis Sutcliffe remained at the Berkshire hospital.</p><p>At his next assessment a different psychiatrist concurred and also said he was cured and could go back to prison.</p><p>Sutcliffe explained: "Four or five years later I saw another doctor from the same hospital. He was the same mind, he wanted to send me back to prison."</p><p>But once again, Sutcliffe remained at Broadmoor where killers and rapists are treated as patients rather than inmates and enjoy greater freedom and privileges than in prison.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/nintchdbpict000258646492.jpg><p>They receive visitors five days a week for up to four hours a day, or six on a Saturday.</p><p>In prison, inmates are normally allowed just two one-hour visits every 4 weeks.</p><p>Broadmoor patients are also allowed access to soft porn, nightly phone calls and lavish barbecue parties.</p><p>Sutcliffe, a Jehovah’s Witness who regularly attends bible classes, made desperate attempts to remain at Broadmoor, including trying to pull the wool over doctors' eyes about his mental state.</p><p>He said: "I can't really say I'm cured because they'd send me back to prison - but I feel ok now."</p><p>The authorities eventually decided to send him back to prison last month after a mental health tribunal ruled he was “bad not mad”.</p><p>The 32 years he spent at Broadmoor cost the public a total of £11 million, including the wasted £3 million over the last 11 years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/nintchdbpict000249250138.jpg><p>The panel, which met in July, concluded his paranoid schizophrenia was successfully treated and he no longer needed specialist care.</p><p>But because he is on a “whole life tariff” he will never be released and must die behind bars.</p><p>Sutcliffe — who now calls himself Peter Coonan after his mother’s maiden name — was given 20 life terms in 1981 for 13 murders and seven attempted murders.</p><p>Earlier this year it emerged cops had launched a cold case review into his links to 13 unsolved killings and violent assaults dating back more than 40 years.</p><p>Broadmoor bosses refused to discuss why he was not sent back to prison earlier.</p><p>A spokesman said: "For reasons of patient confidentiality, we are unable to comment."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoRzgZhwZ2iolamys3nSrqucpJmbs6Z5xaKrZqyfYrSwecGamqRlmpa2rXnIp2RraGBqeqPB02aumqtdobKnwIyipWagn6i9qsDApWScp6Optq%2BzjLKmrmViaX1xfI9mmGaxlZa%2FbrnOq5xo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fpeter-sutcliffe-fit-to-go-back-jail-in-2005-but-was-left-in-hospital-costing-you-240000-a-year-more.html&text=Yorkshire%20Ripper%20Peter%20Sutcliffe%20should%20have%20returned%20to%20jail%2011%20years%20ago%20after%20being%20declared%20sane&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpeter-sutcliffe-fit-to-go-back-jail-in-2005-but-was-left-in-hospital-costing-you-240000-a-year-more.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpeter-sutcliffe-fit-to-go-back-jail-in-2005-but-was-left-in-hospital-costing-you-240000-a-year-more.html&title=Yorkshire%20Ripper%20Peter%20Sutcliffe%20should%20have%20returned%20to%20jail%2011%20years%20ago%20after%20being%20declared%20sane" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fpeter-sutcliffe-fit-to-go-back-jail-in-2005-but-was-left-in-hospital-costing-you-240000-a-year-more.html&title=Yorkshire%20Ripper%20Peter%20Sutcliffe%20should%20have%20returned%20to%20jail%2011%20years%20ago%20after%20being%20declared%20sane" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fpeter-sutcliffe-fit-to-go-back-jail-in-2005-but-was-left-in-hospital-costing-you-240000-a-year-more.html&title=Yorkshire%20Ripper%20Peter%20Sutcliffe%20should%20have%20returned%20to%20jail%2011%20years%20ago%20after%20being%20declared%20sane" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpeter-sutcliffe-fit-to-go-back-jail-in-2005-but-was-left-in-hospital-costing-you-240000-a-year-more.html&description=Yorkshire%20Ripper%20Peter%20Sutcliffe%20should%20have%20returned%20to%20jail%2011%20years%20ago%20after%20being%20declared%20sane" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./courteney-coxs-daughter-coco-will-sing-at-wedding-to-johnny-mcdaid-2015113.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Courteney Cox's Daughter Coco Will Sing at Wedding to Johnny McDaid">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-jennifer-stone.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jennifer Stone? | The US Sun">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
