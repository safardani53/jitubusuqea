He was the youngest child of John Harding Lucas and Blondola Lucas.</p><p>Besides them, he had an elder sister named Cheryl in the family.</p><p>John initially attended the local school in Durham for his early education. Both his parents were teachers, so he did not have much problem learning the letters. He was academically very gifted and always brought good results.</p><p>His parents were often busy working in schools, so he mostly spent time with his sister and grandmother when there was no school. Besides studies, he grew fond of sports at a very young age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/John-Lucas-Sr.-1.jpg><p>According to his sister, Lucas was a shy guy during his childhood. He usually liked to sit alone and read books when he was home. However, he behaved the exact opposite when he went outside to play.</p><p>His childhood friends who played with him in his hometown know him as a lively, interactive guy with good basketball skills. So surprisingly, he had both introvert and outgoing characteristics while growing up.</p><p>After his middle school education, he joined Hillside High School, where his father was the principal. So, he studied there for four years and excelled as a well-trained basketball and tennis player.</p><p>He eventually enrolled in the University of Maryland in College Park, where he obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Education in 1976. Similarly, he later graduated with his Master’s in Education from the University of San Francisco.</p><h2>John Lucas | Career</h2><h3>College Career</h3><p>John Lucas joined the University of Maryland in 1972 and played for the Maryland Terrapins until his graduation in 1976.

However, they participated in the Division I games in Lucas’ junior season.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Robbie Hummel</strong> is an American-born former basketball player working as a sports commentator after retiring.

He started neglecting practice sessions and began missing games without any reason while playing for clubs such as San Antonio Spurs and Washington Wizards (then Washington Bullets).</p><p>He was suspended from the NBA and sent to a rehabilitation center for unlawful practice in 1986.</p><p>However, he returned to the league in the fall of that same year with the Milwaukee Bucks.

Their wedding was organized in Durham and was attended by a few people comprising of their close friends and relatives.</p><p>Debbie was around the same age as John Lucas, and they had known each other since their school days. Her family had known Lucas’ family from the beginning, so they grew up playing together.</p><p>She saw him grow and improve his game from high school to college days and finally make it to the NBA.</p><p>When Lucas took the wrong way of drug abuse while playing in the NBA, she was there to look after him, and she had an essential role in bringing his senses back.</p><p>Consequently, he returned to the court with her motivation and became a confident man.</p><p>The couple is blessed with three children. Their first son, John Lucas III, was born on November 21, 1982. Similarly, their younger son, Jai Lucas, was born on December 5, 1988.</p><p>In addition, Debbie had given birth to their first child, Tarvia Lucas, before their marriage. She was just two years old when they tied the knot.</p><p>Their daughter has a long experience of working as a school teacher.</p><h3>Like Father, Like Son</h3><p>People often jokingly say that playing basketball is their family business. Like Lucas, both his kids are involved in professional basketball games.&nbsp;</p><p>His elder son, John III, had an aptitude for basketball since he was a toddler. He started playing it when he got hold of the ball when he was four.</p><p>He was the state leader in scoring points as he averaged around 30.0 points per game during high school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/John-Lucas-with-his-elder-son-John-III.jpg><p>Even though he went undrafted in the 2005 NBA draft, he played in the NBA and professional basketball leagues in countries like China and Puerto Rico for around twelve years.</p><p>After retiring in 2017, he worked for nearly two years with the Minnesota Timberwolves. Since 2021, he has been working as an assistant coach for another NBA club, Los Angeles Lakers.</p><p>Similarly, his younger son, Jai, took the same path and played basketball. Although his playing career was very brief, he made a career out of basketball and is quite successful.</p><p>He is currently working as an assistant coach for the Kentucky Wildcats. Before that, he was an assistant coach for the Texas Longhorns for four years, where he had played his college basketball.</p><h2>Drug Addiction and Subsequent Recovery</h2><p>John Lucas was involved in drug abuse and alcoholism soon after he started playing in the NBA. However, he said he initially used marijuana and cocaine in small doses to ease the pressure, which soon became chronic addiction.</p><p>In addition, he began consuming beers in large amounts regularly.</p><p>Consequently, he began to miss games, became arrogant, lied to his family members, and even cheated on his wife.</p><p>The Golden State Warriors head coach Al Attles sensed it first and confronted him, but Lucas denied it.</p><p>In 1986, when his situation became worst, the Houston Rockets compelled him to take a doping test which he failed. Consequently, the club released him, and he spent in rehab in California for many months.</p><p>Also, he later took the help of psychiatrists even after returning to the NBA for a few years in Texas.</p><p>After recovery, he became involved in conducting awareness against the illegal usage of drugs among youths. He initially started a fitness program in coalition with the Houston International Hospital.</p><p>Later, he opened up several programs to help addicted athletes, such as John Lucas Treatment and Recovery Center, Students Taking Action Not Drugs (STAND), etc.</p><p>He now runs a <a href=# rel=noopener>John Lucas Enterprises</a> in Texas, which mainly focuses on providing basketball training to children and young athletes by giving counseling classes to youths struggling to escape drug addiction.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Ryan Kelly</strong> is an American professional basketball player who plays forward for the Sun Rockers Shibuya in the B.
