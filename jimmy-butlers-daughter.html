This is why further details regarding Rylee are still under wrap.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the undisclosed details, as per some sources, she was born on the 23rd of October 2019. So presumably, she is <span>4 years old as of 2023.</span></p><h2>Influence&nbsp;</h2><p>It is not a hidden secret that fatherhood changes a man a lot. In the same manner, Jimmy Butler has changed a lot too.</p><p>Perhaps after having a daughter, he has realized the importance of a woman in his life. He has reportedly said that he has to ensure that women are at the same level as men. And it is one thing that he wants to instill in his daughter.</p><p>He wants his daughter to know there is no reason she should be intimidated by others regardless of skin color, race, gender, etc.</p><p>Growing up, his mother did not treat him very well, and maybe that made a negative impression on the women in his life. But things are different now after he got to meet his very own baby girl.</p><p>He has started to think in a different manner that advocates for women’s rights and equality.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/199909169_543447243733169_4766255281293262249_n-e1632031490927.jpg><p>Jimmy reportedly missed the first three games of the Miami Heat in the late 2019 season because of his daughter’s birth.</p><p>With this action, he proved that family is more important to him than anything else.</p><h3>“Family Is Not An Important Thing. It’s Everything.”</h3><p>Butler posted a picture on Instagram that read, “Family is not an important thing. It’s everything.”</p><p>Jimmy led a very troubled childhood and life until he made it to the NBA; maybe that is why he has been paying so much attention, providing the utmost care to his daughter, and has kept her at the top of his priority list.</p><p>He had a troubled relationship with his father and mother.</p><h2>Jimmy Butler’s Troubled Childhood</h2><p>Unknown to many, Jimmy had to go through a series of misfortune and tragedies since his early and late childhood.</p><p>His life story is no different than Hollywood-inspiring movies. His father cold-heartedly left his mother and him to thrive independently, while Jimmy was just a poor infant.</p><p>Later, Jimmy’s mother kicked him out of the house for a heart-breaking reason; she reportedly said that she did not like how he looked.</p><p>Jimmy was just 13 years old at the time. Imagine the psychological pain and suffering a 13-year-old kid had to go through being kicked out by his biological mother.</p><p>He started living here and there, one after another, in his friends’ houses before eventually being adopted by one of his friend’s parents.</p><p>Jimmy befriended <a href=# rel=noopener>Jordan Leslie</a> after playing a match together in his high school; which was a turning point in his life.</p><p>Because it was Jordan’s parents who decided to adopt Jimmy.</p><h3>Relationship With Jordan’s Family</h3><p>Despite having seven children of their own, Jordan’s parents would let Jimmy stay in their house.</p><p>When Jimmy’s stay would be near unwelcome, one of the seven kids would request and ask if Jimmy could stay a bit longer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/202262014_4211014892295289_8969744647142078551_n-e1632032008175.jpg><p>This pattern repeated for a while, and eventually, Jordan’s parents decided to let Jimmy remain for as long as he wanted.</p><p>This decision by Michelle Lambert, Jordan’s mother, and Michael Lambert, father, would be golden as they turned a homeless kid’s life around and paved the way for him to be an NBA star.</p><h2>Wife/Girlfriend</h2><p>The Miami Heat’s power forward is reportedly in a relationship with Kaitlin Nowak, a model, an entrepreneur, a social media influencer, a vlogger, and an NBA star’s girlfriend.</p><p>Kaitlin was born on the 13th of December, 1990, which makes her 32 years old as of 2023.</p><p>She was born in Nebraska, United States, with the zodiac Sagittarius.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/152388005_1084976575303033_3997189256583694372_n-e1632031641986.jpg><p>Her father’s name is Michael Nowak, who reportedly is a businessman.</p><p>Meanwhile, her mother’s name is Natalie Osorio Skutt, and she works as a director of corporate compliance for Signature Performance, Inc. Her family follows Christianity.</p><p>Unlike her husband and most fashion models, she is relatively short and stands 1.65 meters tall.</p><p>Kaitlin started her modeling career after she graduated from college. She has a Bachelor’s in Public Relations, Advertising, and Applied Communications.</p><p>She graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. After graduation, she decided to pursue a career as a model and started participating in numerous beauty peasants and modeling competitions.</p><p>In July 2016, she was featured in ESPY Awards alongside her then-boyfriend Ben Wilkinson, a highly esteemed platform for athletes just as Grammys are for musicians.</p><h2>Kaitlin Nowak’s Instagram</h2><p>After the news of Jimmy and her having a baby together surfaced in the media, she immediately set her Instagram into private mode and deleted the baby registry.</p><p>Her Instagram is no longer set in private mode, but no updates of her being with Jimmy can be seen in any of her posts.</p><p><strong>Instagram (@kaitlinnowak): </strong>5392&nbsp;followers</p><h2>Rylee Butler’s Parents’ Relationship</h2><p>Jimmy Butler and Kaitlin Nowak dodged the media and kept their relationship secret. They never commented on their relationship.</p><p>They do not even have a picture together; that is how secretive they have kept their relationship.</p><p>While it is easy for Kaitlin to stay out of the paparazzi’s reach, such is not the case with Jimmy; he is an NBA star. But he has done pretty well hiding his relationship details with Kaitlin.</p><p>Despite having a baby together, Kaitlin and Jimmy are not together anymore but are co-parenting their child. Due to that, the couple keeps in close contact with each other.</p><p>Even Rylee’s mother moved to Florida from Nebraska to be closer to her.</p><p>The former couple were last seen together at Super Bowl LIV in 2020 with friends and family but have not publicly spoken about their relationship status.</p><p>For Rylee’s mother, Nowak is out of the limelight and has been inactive on her social media. So, we do not know who she is in a relationship with.</p><p>However, Jimmy is doing well in his basketball career. But if we talk about his relationship, there is no solid information about his current girlfriend or marriage; therefore, he might be single.</p><h3>Past Relationships</h3><p>Before meeting Nowak, Jimmy was linked with several other women.</p><p>He was seen with Selena Gomez, and it was rumored that they might be dating.</p><p>It was reported that the two were spotted having dinner together in a local restaurant. However, it remains a rumor because they were never again seen with each other.</p><p>In 2013, he was rumored to be dating Miley Cyrus.&nbsp;However, it seemed that their connection was nothing more than admiration.&nbsp;</p><p>Before dating Kaitlin, Jimmy was in a romantic relationship with Charmaine Piula. Reportedly, they were together in 2015, but we all know by now that it did not last long.</p><p>Similarly, in 2018, he was engaged to Shay Mitchell, an actor, model, and author, but their relationship fell apart quickly.</p><h2>Net Worth Of Jimmy Butler’s Daughter</h2><p>The exact figures about Rylee’s net worth are under review; as she is a little girl, she does not exactly have a source of income.</p><p>However, we have information about her parent’s net worth. Jimmy Butler’s estimated net worth is around $60 million as of 2023.</p><p>Likewise, Kaitlin Nowak’s net worth is estimated to range from $600,000 to $700,000.</p><h2>Social Media Links</h2><p>Neither of the parents (Jimmy Butler or Kaitlin Nowak) has made a dedicated social media account for their lovely and only daughter.</p><p>But we have the details of her father’s Instagram and Twitter. He posts about his games, photos with friends, family, and other ventures.</p><p><strong>Instagram (@jimmybutler):</strong> 9.1 million followers</p><p><strong>Twitter (@JimmyButler):</strong> 936.9k followers</p><p><strong>Facebook (@Jimmy Butler):</strong> 2.5 million followers</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQS)</h2><h3>Does Jimmy Butler speak to his biological mom?</h3><p>Yes, Jimmy talks to his parents.
