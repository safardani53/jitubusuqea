While his salary and prize money in 2020 was just $1.1m, most of it came from his endorsements and sponsors.&nbsp;</p><p>For many people who don’t follow tennis extensively, Kei Nishikori’s gameplay and income can come as surprising!</p><p>For example, in the 2017 Forbes list of highest-earning athletes, he was ranked number 26!&nbsp;</p><p>Not just that, he was ranked even higher than some most notable names in tennis, like <a href=#>Rafael Nadal</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Serena Williams</a>.</p><p>In fact, he made $34 million that year, and among that, a whopping $30 million was just from endorsement!</p><p>Needless to say, he was the second-highest endorser among the tennis players that year.</p><h2>Kei Nishikori Net Worth: House and Cars</h2><h3>House</h3><p>Though Kei hails from the land of the rising sun, he has been living in the states for a long time now. He started training for tennis at the young age of 13.&nbsp;</p><p>Before he left Japan for the states, he lived in Matsue city with his parents. They lived in a two-story house just 20 minutes’ drive ahead from Matsue station.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/c1.vgtstatic.com/thumb/1/9/190509-v2-xl/kei-nishikoris-house.jpg><p>Fast forward to now, the Japanese tennis player now lives in a lavish mansion that he purchased back in 2013.
