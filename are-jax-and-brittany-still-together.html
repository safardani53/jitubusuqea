Of course, folks think that a lack of presence on your partner's social media can be a sign of trouble in paradise.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>However, Jax instantly put the rumors to rest by posting himself and Brittany attending the 2022 People's Choice Awards and interacting with fans in the comments sections.</p><p>"You two look incredible together!

"Although this is difficult to share, Brittany and I will not be returning for another season of Vanderpump Rules.

My focus is on that," he said at the time. "It's just not fair to the show either to be like, 'OK, I'm going to sign up for this but I’m only going to be able to do these, this, and this.' So, you know, I was okay with the decision, you know, to hang it up."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While Jax and Brittany opted to remain off television for the most part since they left the long-running Bravo series, Jax is part of the E! reality show House of Villains. He's among other notable reality TV characters from various shows, but his drive to compete on the show comes from the possibility of winning prize money for his and Brittany's family.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jax and Brittany may be back for a 'Vanderpump Rules' spinoff.</h2><p>In June 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> reported that Brittany and Jax, along with another former Vanderpump Rules star Kristen Doute, are in talks to get their own Bravo series. The show would follow the three of them and their own circle of friends outside of the SUR family. If this does come to fruition, then chances are, Jax is nowhere near as finished as reality TV as we once thought.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflr%2Bmecmar2aZnpl6o77IrauapqliwLW1y6VkraeXmsGpsdE%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fare-jax-and-brittany-still-together.html&text=Are%20Jax%20Taylor%20and%20Brittany%20Cartwright%20Still%20Together%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-jax-and-brittany-still-together.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-jax-and-brittany-still-together.html&title=Are%20Jax%20Taylor%20and%20Brittany%20Cartwright%20Still%20Together%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fare-jax-and-brittany-still-together.html&title=Are%20Jax%20Taylor%20and%20Brittany%20Cartwright%20Still%20Together%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fare-jax-and-brittany-still-together.html&title=Are%20Jax%20Taylor%20and%20Brittany%20Cartwright%20Still%20Together%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-jax-and-brittany-still-together.html&description=Are%20Jax%20Taylor%20and%20Brittany%20Cartwright%20Still%20Together%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./eric-lindross-girlfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eric Lindross Girlfriend: Who is Eric Lindros Dating?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-rob-bourdon-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Rob Bourdon Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
