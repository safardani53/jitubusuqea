The Turkish court decided to suspend the singer’s earlier injunction requiring her to check in and sign at the closest police station once a week. They will, however, continue to keep her worldwide travel restriction in effect.</p><p>During the trial, Gulsen explained to the court how she was assaulted by the public. She claims she has been lynched and beaten several times due to her clothing. Her reputation as a performer had also suffered since over 50 of her gigs had been canceled. She stated:</p><p>“As a woman, a wife, and a mother, I was verbally attacked and assaulted several times.” All of this is my punishment for becoming Gülşen.”</p><p>According to court transcripts, the 46-year-old will be excused from the proceedings. The next hearing is scheduled on December 21.</p><h2>Gulsen dropped out of university to pursue a music career.</h2><p>Gulsen Colakoglu (née Bayraktar) is his full name. She was born on May 29, 1976, in Istanbul and reared there. Her parents, Arslan and Nimet, have three children. After graduating from ehremini Anadolu High School, she studied Turkish classical music at Istanbul Technical University. She started playing in nightclubs and pubs throughout Istanbul during her first year of college but found it difficult to balance her education with her enthusiasm. Gulsen dropped out of university after her first year.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gulsen-1.jpg alt=Gulsen width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Following this, the singer established herself as a musician with her first album, Be Adam (Oh Man! ), released in 1995. Her popularity grew swiftly as a result of her distinct voice. However, her popularity plummeted almost as rapidly once the TV sensor board deemed the music video for Sarşnm (my Blonde) indecent.&nbsp;Despite her tumultuous career, Colakoglu’s combination of pop and old Ottoman compositions, as well as her predilection for scandals, has earned her the moniker “Turkish Madonna.”</p><h2>Why was Gulsen arrested?</h2><p>During the August 25 show, the musician made a remark about a fellow crew member, claiming that his “perversion” resulted from his attendance at hatip school. According to the singer:</p><p>“I went to the Imam Hatip schools.” That is where the perversion arises.”</p><p>People called for her arrest after seeing videos of her making this remark. The Imam Hatip school is a contentious topic in the nation because, despite its religious foundation, it has been implicated in multiple s*xual assault controversies. According to speculation, this is a cover for various illicit operations taking place using public funds.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gulsen-2.jpg alt=Gulsen width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite claiming her innocence, she was detained for five days for promoting hate and animosity and was subsequently placed under home arrest for 15 days. Gulsen said that the remark was made as a jest between the two buddies. The singer stated:</p><p>“I did not exhibit an attitude that would promote hostility and enmity among the people.” “I did not want to attack a third person, a socioeconomic class, or a segment of society.”</p><p>Gulsen’s arrest sparked outrage on social media, with many thinking she was targeted because of her outspoken support for the LGBTQIA+ community and liberal beliefs.&nbsp;She is presently sentenced to three years in jail for her crimes.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGierqSjmrtus86eqmasn2LBqbGMnKauqqRiwbB5wKmnnpmcYrOwvoyhnKtln6y7brXNrKylrKNirq%2BwjKGYraqVmXq1u9aaqZ2rXaeyrbXGoqauq12osKm7zqWqaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgulsen-goes-to-the-court-to-appeal-for-her-own-insults-and-hatred-towards-religious-schools.html&text=Gulsen%20Goes%20To%20The%20Court%20To%20Appeal%20For%20Her%20Own%20Insults%20And%20Hatred%20Towards%20Religious%20Schools&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgulsen-goes-to-the-court-to-appeal-for-her-own-insults-and-hatred-towards-religious-schools.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgulsen-goes-to-the-court-to-appeal-for-her-own-insults-and-hatred-towards-religious-schools.html&title=Gulsen%20Goes%20To%20The%20Court%20To%20Appeal%20For%20Her%20Own%20Insults%20And%20Hatred%20Towards%20Religious%20Schools" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgulsen-goes-to-the-court-to-appeal-for-her-own-insults-and-hatred-towards-religious-schools.html&title=Gulsen%20Goes%20To%20The%20Court%20To%20Appeal%20For%20Her%20Own%20Insults%20And%20Hatred%20Towards%20Religious%20Schools" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgulsen-goes-to-the-court-to-appeal-for-her-own-insults-and-hatred-towards-religious-schools.html&title=Gulsen%20Goes%20To%20The%20Court%20To%20Appeal%20For%20Her%20Own%20Insults%20And%20Hatred%20Towards%20Religious%20Schools" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgulsen-goes-to-the-court-to-appeal-for-her-own-insults-and-hatred-towards-religious-schools.html&description=Gulsen%20Goes%20To%20The%20Court%20To%20Appeal%20For%20Her%20Own%20Insults%20And%20Hatred%20Towards%20Religious%20Schools" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./future-single-dating-blac-chyna-tattoo-name.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Im Single!
