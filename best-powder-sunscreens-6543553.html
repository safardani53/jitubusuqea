It's easy to forget once you've applied your initial layer, or there's the fact that it simply feels like a bit of a nuisance post-makeup application. We totally understand not wanting to slather on some creamy SPF on top of your foundation (yuck), but that's where powder sunscreen comes in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"Powder sunscreen is no different, ingredient-wise, than a mineral-based sunscreen," explains Christina Lee Chung, M.D. F.A.A.D. "In fact, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide exist naturally as powders, so instead of putting these particles in a lotion, cream, or spray base, they are allowed to exist in their natural form."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Think of it as your favorite setting powder mixed with UV blockers. And not only do these brush-on powder formulas offer protection against the sun's harmful rays, but they are also specifically designed to work with your makeup, making reapplying a cinch rather than an annoyance. Thanks to the powder formulation, they also mattify oily skin.

Even with its $70 price tag, skincare experts and customers all over can't get enough of this product. It has garnered over 2,200 5-star reviews on Amazon, which is nothing to scoff at. It's a super lightweight option that doesn't clog your pores, making it an ideal powder sunscreen for those with acne-prone skin. It also protects your skin from infrared heat and blue light, an excellent added benefit if you're looking for a multipurpose product.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends it for active use, so it's an excellent choice for people who spend lots of time outdoors," Chung explains. "It's also cruelty-free and non-nano for those who prioritize an organic, green lifestyle. Its price point is a bit higher, so some of the finer details may not be worth it for some, but you get what you pay for with this one."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF:</strong> 30-50<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size:</strong> 6.2 grams<strong> </strong>|<strong> Cruelty-Free:</strong> Yes&nbsp;<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-scalp-supergoop-poof-100-mineral-part-powder-spf-35></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Scalp</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Supergoop!

The brand's Mineral Part and Scalp Powder SPF 35 has garnered a 4-star rating on Amazon with its 100 percent mineral zinc oxide formulation that delivers broad-spectrum UV protection. The best part is you can apply this SPF to your scalp without worrying about any cakiness or build-up. The sheer formula helps reduce shine and smooths the skin's appearance thanks to the addition of coated silica, which is known to diffuse light and help the appearance of visible pores. "It does not get cakey or flake; it stays under the radar and is almost invisible," dermatologist Ava Shamban, M.D., explains. "It helps to absorb sebum, seal, and set on the scalp and part lines with 100 percent mineral protection." It's also formulated with ceramides and olive glycerides, which help lock in moisture. Chung adds, "You're more likely to find dry shampoo than makeup in my bathroom, and I love that you can kill two birds with one stone with [this] powder!"<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF:</strong> 45 | <strong>Size:</strong> 4.25 grams |<strong> Cruelty-Free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-a-dewy-glow-is-clinical-perfectint-powder-spf-40></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for a Dewy Glow</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>iS Clinical PerfecTint Powder SPF 40</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="iS Clinical PerfecTint Powder SPF 40" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Y8-aXOC6eATHq19Skxv6f0asG3Q=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/iS-Clinical-PerfecTint-Powder-SPF-40-116a404591e94e05a29a7afc0e154421.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dermstore</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We're all looking for that natural dewy glow — minus the sweat — and this powder SPF does just that. It offers sun protection for all skin types, including dry, mature, sensitive, combination, and balanced skin. “People with drier skin might stay away from powder sunscreen, but not this one,” says Shamban. “PerfecTint is ultra hydrating and does not accentuate dry patches and is great for all skin types.” It provides multilevel broad-spectrum UVA/UVB protection and leaves you with a silky smooth coverage that minimizes the appearance of pores and absorbs surface oil. This formula also features the brand’s antioxidant Extremozyme technology, which, according to the brand's site, “is clinically proven to help protect skin from environmental stressors while providing hydration even in powder form.” This powder sunscreen comes in five shades ranging from ivory to deep and can also be used on your face, scalp, and décolleté. That being said, it is on the pricier side with a price tag of $78.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF:</strong> 40<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size:</strong> 3.5 grams<strong> </strong>| <strong>Cruelty-Free:</strong> Yes<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-hawaiian-tropic-mineral-translucent-sunscreen-powder-brush-spf-30></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hawaiian Tropic Sunscreen Powder</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Hawaiian Tropic Mineral Powder Sunscreen Brush, SPF 30" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/bcvI6hMVNlfIh2iu_PtEfesv6Ag=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Hawaiian-Tropic-Mineral-Powder-Sunscreen-Brush-SPF-30-bb65db7c865c48f684afeba15ed30aae.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hawaiian Tropic Sunscreen Powder is our pick for those looking for an affordable option that is easily accessible at your local drugstore. Chung tells us that this powder "hits all the important items you should look for in powder sunscreen." She adds, "It's a great starter product for people who haven't dabbled much in cosmetics."<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Many reviewers stated that it provides excellent coverage and is super easy to throw in your bag when you're on the go. It's created with naturally sourced sea minerals that help absorb excess oil throughout the day and provides a matte finish. The translucent formula is known for blending well into most skin tones. This 100 percent mineral powder sunscreen gives UVA/UVB protection without chemical filters and is free of oxybenzone and octinoxate. "It also has a form of vitamin C which is a great antioxidant to protect your skin," Dhaval G. Bhanusali, M.D. says. This option is also dermatologist-tested and offers a light topical scent if you're looking for a fragrance that transports you to a faraway island instead of being stuck at home or work (one can dream, right?).<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF:</strong> 30 | <strong>Size:</strong> 4.25 grams |<strong> Cruelty-Free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-acneic-skin-derma-e-sun-protection-mineral-powder-spf-30></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Acneic Skin</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>DERMA E DERMA E Sun Protection Mineral Powder SPF 30</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=" DERMA E Sun Protection Mineral Powder SPF 30" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/FKSpHeXAxZd-K9gGhWErPpIiSkA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sun-protection-mineral-face-powder-spf-30-2ddb98f8c8a34ba889994a705912cfe0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Derma-E's powder sunscreen is an excellent option for acne-prone and sensitive skin. This 100 percent vegan and cruelty-free product is only made with 12 natural ingredients and was developed in collaboration with makeup artist Ash Deleon (so you know it works great with makeup). This natural formula is “not just good for acne but anyone with sensitive skin,” says Chung. It’s also packed with skincare-focused ingredients like vitamin E, which is said to improve your skin's texture and provide moisture; green tea, which helps give your skin vital antioxidants; and chamomile flower extract, which helps soothe and calm irritated skin. “It is a mattifying powder which gives the skin an even-toned look, and it's also great for sensitive/acne-prone and mature skin,” Shamban explains. If you have mature skin, this powder SPF is ideal as it contains mica and silica, which help plump and give your skin a nice glow.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF:</strong> 30<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>4 grams<strong> </strong>| <strong>Cruelty-Free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-water-resistant-brush-on-block-mineral-sunscreen-powder></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Water-Resistant</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Brush-On Block Brush-On Block Mineral Sunscreen Powder</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Brush-On Block Mineral Sunscreen Powder" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/RWJEUa_4wAGRa7aOpBmRItGZmc4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/brush-on-block-mineral-sunscreen-powdeR-83343792207e49518dca5e0c3fac72d7.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Looking for a water-resistant option that offers broad-spectrum protection from the sun's UVA and UVB rays? Try this SPF 30 mineral sunscreen powder that is water-resistant and sweat-proof for up to 80 minutes! "This is a water-resistant sunscreen that protects against UVA and UVB rays, but I recommend reapplying after any activity and every 2 hours regardless," Shamban explains. It's perfect for touch-up lounging by the pool or hanging out at the beach after a day. Just a reminder that powder sunscreens are only meant for reapplications. "Do not fool yourself," cautions Shereene Idriss, M.D. "This is the cherry on top of the ice cream, not a substitute for sunscreen — just a top-off. If you're going to the beach or the pool, pick up a lotion or spray sunscreen." It currently has over 2,136 reviews and a 4.5-star rating on Amazon. Customers are raving that it's also easy to apply to your ears, scalp, and hands. They also mentioned the brush itself makes the application process super seamless.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF: </strong>30 | <strong>Size</strong>: 3.4 grams | <strong>Cruelty-Free:</strong> Yes</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-multitasking-powder-sunscreen-isdin-isdinceutics-mineral-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Multitasking Powder Sunscreen</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ISDIN Mineral Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ISDIN Isdinceutics Mineral Brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/Q1xVD_FF75rT-rR__Dc3aXF_4XA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/isdin-isdinceutics-mineral-brush-28f5bedf66db4e458afa5c469136cbe8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Good For</span> <span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Who It’s Not Good For</span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What's better than a beauty product that does one thing really well? One that multitasks and makes your life a whole lot easier. If you're in the market for an SPF that also doubles as an anti-aging product, ISDIN's Mineral Brush Powder is right up your alley. This mineral sunscreen also protects your skin from certain environmental stressors thanks to its key ingredients, as Chung explains. "This is a favorite among my office staff. It contains a combination of zinc, titanium, iron oxides, and mica to protect skin from blue light and infrared radiation." This 2-in-1 gives you gorgeous coverage and sun protection. That being said, the shade range is nonexistent. "This product only comes in one translucent shade, so it may not be suitable for darker skin tones," Chung continues. It's also important to note that this powder sunscreen is expensive, coming in at $55.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>SPF:</strong> 50<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size:</strong> 4 grams<strong> </strong>| <strong>Cruelty-Free:</strong> Not stated</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-pick-the-right-powder-sunscreen></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Pick the Right Powder Sunscreen</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>SPF</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When choosing a powder sunscreen, the most crucial factor to consider is choosing the correct SPF. You should look for a broad-spectrum product that protects against both UVA and UVB rays (as well as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>blue light rays</a>, for added protection.). “I like at least an SPF 30 or higher and something that is lightweight,” Bhanusali tells us. “Some powder sunscreens can get messy, and so it's important to have one that is easy to transport and something you can keep with you at all times.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ingredients</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re wondering if there are any ingredients you should avoid, allow Shamban to explain. She often chooses a powder sunscreen that’s “free of talc," a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>controversial ingredient</a> that, in its natural form, may cause serious health concerns (though more studies need to be done). As for her green-light ingredients, Shamban says that likes those "full of micronized zinc and lots of antioxidants."</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ease of Use</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also important to find the right component for you. “Powder sunscreen can come in a few different packaging types including pumps, pressed into a compact, and most commonly, as an all-in-one brush,” Idriss explains. “When applying, you would brush it on as you would normally apply powdered makeup, which can be applied to your face, neck, and chest area. I also love applying it to the part in my hair to avoid a burnt, itchy scalp, a place that often gets overlooked when applying sunscreen.”<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-9249a002-fc01-4368-8822-7185b97793aa></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=48.792452830189><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can I wear powder sunscreen alone?</span></p><p>The short answer is no, because it doesn’t provide enough protection. “Powders have a lower coverage density and lack enough ‘stick’ to the skin. The best way to think about powder sunscreen is as a semi-sheer finishing layer, which makes it a great sunscreen cosmetic but not the best option for standalone sun protection,” Chung explains.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.96978021978022><p><span class=accordion__title>Where can you apply powder sunscreen?</span></p><p>Most dermatologists only recommend using powder sunscreen on your face and scalp — just remember they should only be used as touch-ups. To ensure full protection, you should apply an even layer on your face, neck, and chest. It's important to note that this doesn't omit the need for applying a base layer of a regular SPF or a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>color correction cream</a> that contains SPF.</p><p>Idriss doesn't recommend using powder sunscreen as your sole sunscreen because "it's hard to get enough dispersed evenly onto your skin for sufficient protection." She recommends applying regular lotion sunscreen before you leave your house and bringing a powder sunscreen along with you to touch up throughout the day.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.95238095238095><p><span class=accordion__title>How often do you reapply a powder sunscreen?</span></p><p>You should reapply it every two hours for touch-ups, and to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>absorb oil</a> from sweat. But, as we mentioned, make sure to apply regular sunscreen as your base as well.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Nikita Charuza</a> is a freelance beauty and fashion editor with almost a decade of experience and is the founder of the "happy headcare" line Squigs Beauty.
