Anyone from any walk of life could be targetted by this and it feels like people don't give a s***.</p><p>"I have never made a single drop of sexual content in my life but now they just assume that I have and I must want this.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE IN NEWS">READ MORE IN NEWS</h2><p>“It’s not easy to differentiate this from reality. If people see this video in 10 or 20 years' time, no one will know whether I was a sex worker or this was a <a href=#>deepfake</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“It could potentially get you fired from jobs in the future if people think you’ve done sex work and it affects your security, how people treat you and you are stigmatised.</p><p>“This will impact my life in a similar way to <a href=#>revenge porn</a>, so I’m just frustrated, tired, and numb.</p><p>"This was nonconsensual and the impacts are permanent.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><h2>Deepfakes searches surge by 1,000%</h2><p>Sweet Anita became aware of the videos after another streamer <a href=#>Brandon Ewing, known as Atrioc</a>, accidentally shared a link to a <a href=#>deepfake</a> video site while <a href=#>live streaming</a> last month.</p><p>The site contained deepfake movies involving a number of Twitch stars, and Atrioc's revelation sparked a furious online backlash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/grabs-youtube-twitch-atrioc-full-797916056.jpg><p>Later, in a tearful video alongside his wife Arianna, he apologised to women branding his actions "gross" and "embarrassing".</p><p>The apology appeared in Sweet Anita's newsfeed and after Googling her name, she was horrified to discover multiple videos had been made of her.</p><p>In January alone, <a href=#>Google</a> searches for ‘deepfake porn’ soared by more than 1,000 per cent, according to <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Scams.info</a>.</p><p>In the week after Sweet Anita and others discovered they had been targeted, searches for ‘how to make a deepfake’ rose by 120 per cent - while the search term ‘are deepfakes illegal’ soared by 5,000 per cent.&nbsp;</p><h2>Waves of abuse</h2><p>Sweet Anita says the fake X-rated videos are the latest in a long line of degrading abuse against her and other female content creators, who are regularly sexualised by fans.</p><p>She told us: “Before deepfakes, people had been photoshopping still images to have my face on porn.</p><p>“People have amassed huge collections of clips of me getting up and walking away from the camera during live streams to look at my body, even though it’s clothed.&nbsp;</p><p>“There are people who make whole <a href=#>Reddit</a> forums just to roleplay as me, where they are like, ‘I’m going to pretend to be Sweet Anita, do you want to do spicy DMs with me?'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/grabs-youtube-twitch-atrioc-full-797915625.jpg><p>“There have been whole communities of thousands who get together to sexualise me, I did not consent to any of it.</p><p>“It’s one extra thing in an endless and exhaustive list that female content creators have to take on that are traumatising, take thousands of pounds to address and require therapy to deal with.”</p><h2>'It's not fantasy, it's permanent'</h2><p>The streamer is also frustrated about the laws - or lack of them - surrounding deepfake technology, claiming cases are “not taken seriously” and often involve lengthy and costly legal action to remove content.</p><p>Legal expert Ron Moscona, of London’s <a href=# aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Dorsey & Whitney</a>, describes the current landscape as “very messy” and acknowledges little can be done.&nbsp;</p><p>He told us: “You can still make a complaint about a deepfake being circulated on social media or search engines and demand they remove it but it’s not always easy.</p><p>“It’s also difficult to get financial compensation when you can’t identify the instigator or if they are anonymous.”</p><p>Ron is hopeful the Government’s Online Safety Bill, which is currently in the House Of Lords, could “provide an extra layer of protection” for victims.&nbsp;</p><p>He said: “It’s not designed specifically for deepfakes but will force social media and search engine operators to stop unlawful material surfacing - previously they would only respond to complaints."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/taken-without-permission-social-media-797916393.jpg><p>Sweet Anita claims there is a “lack of empathy” among many online too, with some “blaming women” for the content being out there and others belittling it as fans' “sexual fantasies”.</p><p>She added: “They don’t seem to think through what’s happened to us is a reality, they just see it as women complaining about being objects of sexual fantasies.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s really, really difficult but the greatest challenge so far has been trying to explain to people the real genuine impact on people’s lives and how permanent it is too.</p><p>“It’s non-consensual, nobody did anything to bring it on themselves and they just have to live with consequences now.”</p><h2>Apology 'too little too late'</h2><p>The unnamed deepfake pornography creator has since apologised, stating it was “immoral” and removed the content from their pages.</p><p>While the website has been taken down, there are many more that still host the clips and Sweet Anita says she is seeking legal advice.</p><p>She isn’t swayed by the creator’s apology, insisting the person “does not care how it affects” victims.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/twitch-qtcinderella-797966210.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/twitch-qtcinderella-797966132.jpg><p>She told us: “I don’t really accept the apology because it’s too little too late.</p><p>"It looks like damage control from someone facing a pending lawsuit rather than actual remorse.”&nbsp;</p><p>Another victim Blaire, an American known as QTCinderella on Twitch, vowed to sue the creator and lashed out at those who "violated" her with the videos.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>In an emotional video, she said: ”F*** the people DM’ing me pictures of myself from my website.</p><p>"This is what it looks like, this is what the pain looks like.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ351hZFubXFnlJqysbLApJxmqJ%2Bnu27CyJ2cqGWjrLKmwIyapaKskWLDqq%2FToqRmrKeewaS0jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdeepfake-porn-video-sweet-anita-victim-twitch.html&text=&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdeepfake-porn-video-sweet-anita-victim-twitch.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdeepfake-porn-video-sweet-anita-victim-twitch.html&title=" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdeepfake-porn-video-sweet-anita-victim-twitch.html&title=" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdeepfake-porn-video-sweet-anita-victim-twitch.html&title=" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdeepfake-porn-video-sweet-anita-victim-twitch.html&description=" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./evander-holyfield.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Evander Holyfield [2023 Update]: Early Life &amp;amp; Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-jill-chin-bachelor-in-paradise-4853319.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Jill Chin?
