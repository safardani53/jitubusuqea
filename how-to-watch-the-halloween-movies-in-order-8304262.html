The film largely inspired the slasher sub-genre and established Curtis as a scream queen.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The original flick spawned 12 additional movies, and the franchise has made more than $1 billion and counting.

"If I hadn't been in Halloween, I wouldn't have met John Landis, the director who put me in Trading Places and showed the world I can be funny. That got me A Fish Called Wanda. That led to True Lies, which led to Freaky Friday. Dot connected, dot connected."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Connecting the dots of the actual Halloween movie timeline, however, can be a bit tricky.

She wrote in an essay for PEOPLE that the film began as an idea from film producer and financier, Moustapha Akkad, who "wanted to make a '<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>babysitter-slasher movie</a>.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She recalled that Carpenter, then an unknown, and his girlfriend Debra Hill developed the story for Halloween from that prompt.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They added high school girls who strolled down tree-lined streets and teased each other about boys. They threw in children who needed babysitters and then a carnival, which led to dressing up in costumes on Halloween night," she wrote. "The final ingredient in that idyll: a man in a white mask who would become the embodiment of pure evil. This was a powerful recipe."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Curtis was paid $8,000 for Halloween, calling it "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a fortune</a>" for the time, especially for her first leading role. The film, produced for just $300,000, raked in $47 million at the box office and went on to become the most commercially successful independent movie ever at the time.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>Halloween II (1981)</strong></span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Jamie Lee Curtis Halloween II.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the success of Halloween, Curtis returned for Halloween II, released in 1981. Carpenter and Hill produced and wrote the screenplay for the sequel, with Rick Rosenthal directing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The film begins one minute after the events of Halloween: Laurie Strode is hospitalized, and Michael Myers stalks her and brutally murders anyone who gets in his way.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rosenthal <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>said in a 2002 interview</a> that while he wanted to remain loyal to Carpenter's original vision of Halloween, he also wanted to put his own stamp on Halloween II.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You have to try hard to maintain the style of the first movie. I wanted it to feel like a two-parter," he explained. "You have the responsibility and the restraints of the style that's been set. It was the same crew. My philosophy was to do more of a thriller than a slasher movie."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Halloween II reveals that Strode is actually Myers' younger sister who was adopted after their parents' deaths, with the records sealed to protect her.

While being transferred from Haddonfield Memorial Hospital to a sanitarium, Myers hears ambulance personnel mention that he has a niece — Laurie Strode's daughter, Jamie Lloyd (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>played by Danielle Harris</a>). Jamie lives with a foster family. Myers brutally and relentlessly pursues Jamie throughout Haddonfield, leaving countless people dead in his wake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Screenwriter Dennis Etchison originally wrote the script for Halloween 4 with Carpenter and Hill, and it was quite different, with a Footloose-style ban of Halloween in Haddonfield. However, creative differences <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>reportedly led Carpenter and Hill to exit</a> and sell their rights to the Halloween franchise, and the studio went with a script from Alan McElroy instead. McElroy penned Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers in just 10 days, completing it just before a writers' strike.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989)</strong></span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Donald L.
