This includes her 2019 series In The Dark, for which she is currently getting world-wide recognition.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Mattfeld Never Hesitated To Show Off Her Boyfriend, Andrew Wright</h2><p>Perry Mattfeld’s supposed boyfriend, Andrew Wright, is a professional baseball player who played for the MLB team Dayton Dragons.&nbsp;It is uncertain from&nbsp;when the couple was together. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The first-ever hint that can be found regarding her relationship with Wright was on a Twitter post dated June 12, 2016. The tweet was made by USC Baseball handle congratulating Andrew Wright (@AESDUB) for his selection in the MLB team Dayton Dragons.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>This tweet was then retweeted by none other than Mattfeld, who seemed to cheer on for Wright’s selection.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>There is nothing to take from that 2016 post as it&nbsp;didn’t allude to their relationship. If anything, it could have just been a nice gesture from a friend. Speculation about their dating was still up&nbsp;in the air until Mattfeld herself made it official in January 2017.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the Instagram post dated January 5,&nbsp;2017, Mattfeld posted an intimate picture with Wright and wrote the caption, “been a year since I tricked him into being my boyfriend. I love you @aesdub. Aesdub is the username that Andrew Wright goes by, both in his Instagram and Twitter&nbsp;handles.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Going by that post, it seems that Mattfeld was indeed dating Wright ever since January 2016 and people were right in speculating when she retweeted Wright’s selection into the MLB draft.&nbsp;</p><p>After that post, she posted few others posts&nbsp;to shower some more words of adoration towards her boyfriend.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Interestingly, another post by Perry from&nbsp;September 2017 led to another speculation, which hinted that the two didn’t just start dating recently but knew each other since their university days.&nbsp;</p><p>In the September 2, 2017 post, Mattfeld can be seen in her USC cheerleading uniform, looking mesmerizing as she lifts&nbsp;her hand in the air in&nbsp;exuberance. The interesting part is that Andrew Wright was also a USC major&nbsp;who graduated in business administration.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Another interesting bit about that September post is that it became the last time since fans got&nbsp;to see her boyfriend. This includes her other social media handles, such as&nbsp;Twitter. The lack of posts further&nbsp;churned another rumor -- this time about their separation.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2>Portfolio Building and Recognition From 'In The Dark'</h2><p>Perry Mattfeld first aspired to be a ballet dancer. And her family helped her in this endeavor placing&nbsp;her under the guidance of the famous actress/dance instructor, Debbie Allen.</p><p>For the next nine&nbsp;years, Allen would cast Mattfeld in many productions such as Ms. Allen’s World Premiere musical and Alex in Wonderland.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>She excelled at every opportunity she got and, by the mere age of 12, became a full-time ‘employee’ of Mattel American Girl Dolls musical troupe.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>The ballet dancer turned actress’ first foray&nbsp;into the small-screen was in Disney’s The Wizards of Waverly Place (2009). She quickly followed that up with Secret Diary of an American Cheerleader (2012) and Escape from Polygamy (2013).</p><p>Her portfolio leading up to 2017 was mostly catered towards children or young adults.&nbsp;Her first appearance in an&nbsp;adult-oriented project came in the form of her role as Mel in&nbsp;Shameless (2017-2018), which made others take notice of her.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The following year, in 2019, she made yet another bigger leap in the small-screen by taking up a role in In The Dark.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In it, Mattfeld played&nbsp;Murphy, an anti-social blind woman who struggles with alcoholism while taking a job that she despises. The job in question consists of&nbsp;training guide dogs at a training school run by her parents (played by Kathleen York and Derek Webster). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Her seemingly ordinary life is then turned topsy turvy when her friend is murdered, and she has to undertake a seemingly impossible mission of finding out the killer.&nbsp;</p><h2>A Real Person Inspired Her Character And The Show</h2><p>Mattfeld’s role as an anti-social blind woman unwillingly working at her parent’s home but then later finding out about her friend’s murder certainly sounds very complex for any actor. While, Mattfeld is talented, fortunately for her, her character was based on a real person named Laurie.&nbsp;</p><p>When she met with her real-life counterpart, she immediately connected with what she was going through.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">In the interview with goldenglobes.com</a>, Matfield praised Laurie’s sarcastic and bold approach to life. She said that upon meeting Laurie, she felt, for the first time, that she had met someone with a disability that wasn’t actually disabled.&nbsp;</p><p>According to her, in addition to being the character consultant for the show, she also became a staff writer.&nbsp;</p><p>For her role, Mattfeld became Laurie's shadow, in that she followed Laurie from the moment she woke up, made breakfast, used her phone to doing her makeup.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While all this process certainly seems daunting for any actor, Mattfeld seems to have taken it with stride. Her performance as Murphy earned her rave reviews and she was even featured&nbsp;in the 2020 May edition of Golden Globes magazine.&nbsp;</p><p>Judging by her career trajectory and the lack of any posts hinting at her relationship status, we can assume two things: either the rising actress is single, or Wright has transformed from a certain boyfriend to 'a husband'.&nbsp;Only time will tell.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnoJq%2Fs8WMppitrJaauaV5waiwn6qZmruleceuqpuZnpl7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fperry-mattfeld-boyfriend-husband-html.html&text=Who%20Is%20Perry%20Mattfelds%20Boyfriend%3f%20Inside%20Her%20Relationship%20History&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fperry-mattfeld-boyfriend-husband-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fperry-mattfeld-boyfriend-husband-html.html&title=Who%20Is%20Perry%20Mattfelds%20Boyfriend%3f%20Inside%20Her%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fperry-mattfeld-boyfriend-husband-html.html&title=Who%20Is%20Perry%20Mattfelds%20Boyfriend%3f%20Inside%20Her%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fperry-mattfeld-boyfriend-husband-html.html&title=Who%20Is%20Perry%20Mattfelds%20Boyfriend%3f%20Inside%20Her%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fperry-mattfeld-boyfriend-husband-html.html&description=Who%20Is%20Perry%20Mattfelds%20Boyfriend%3f%20Inside%20Her%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./bella-thorne-daisy-dukes-crop-top-coachella-pics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bella Thorne Rocks Daisy Dukes &amp;amp; Crop Top At Coachella: Pics  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./c153e924-c1a5-9c6a-6397-cec09e9f7c58.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Criminal Minds Season 11 Episode 6: Pariahville">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
