and sometimes dug up bodies from their graves to eat.</p><p>The men who survived were desperate for female company — which was worrying the company shareholders back in London.</p><p>They feared that other settlers might follow the example of Lincolnshire-born John Rolfe, who married Pocahontas, the daughter of the local native chief, in 1614.</p><p>She had reportedly earlier saved the life of another settler about to be killed by her dad.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000320972804.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000320946806.jpg><p>But such interracial marriages were viewed with suspicion by the authorities, who believed that native women would plot with their families to destroy their new husbands, and thereby England’s new colonial outpost.</p><p>Hence the plan cooked up to lure over a larger group of Englishwomen, en masse.</p><p>Many of the 90 who set sail probably only really began to get an inkling of what they were really in for when their ship drew into the river that led to the settlement</p><p>Historian Martha McCartney said: “Imagine what it must have been like to sail up the James and see all these tree-lined shores — and hear all these tales about the Indians and the dangers they posed?
